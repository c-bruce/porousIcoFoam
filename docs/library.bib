abstract = {This paper entails the study of the pulsed-jet propulsion inspired by cephalopods in the frame of underwater bioinspired robotics. This propulsion routine involves a sequence of consecutive cycles of inflation and collapse of an elastic bladder, which, in the robotics artefact developed by the authors, is enabled by a cable-driven actuation of a deformable shell composed of rubber-like materials. In the present work an all-comprehensive formulation is derived by resorting to a coupled approach that comprises of a model of the structural dynamics of the cephalopod-like elastic bladder and a model of the pulsed-jet thrust production. The bladder, or mantle, is modelled by means of geometrically exact, axisymmetric, nonlinear shell theory, which yields an accurate estimation of the forces involved in driving the deformation of the structure in water. By coupling these results with those from a standard thrust model, the behaviour of the vehicle propelling itself in water is derived. The constitutive laws of the shell are also exploited as control laws with the scope of replicating the muscle activation routine observed in cephalopods. The model is employed to test various shapes, material properties and actuation routines of the mantle. The results are compared in terms of speed performance in order to identify suitable design guidelines. Altogether, the model is tested in more than 50 configurations, eventually providing useful insight for the development of more advanced vehicles and bringing evidence of its reliability in studying the dynamics of both man-made cephalopodinspired robots and live specimens.},

abstract = {We consider the generic problem of wake instabilities past fixed axisymmetric bodies, and focus on the extreme cases of a sphere and a flat disk. Numerical results reveal that the wakes of these two bodies evolve differently as the Reynolds number is increased. Especially, two new vortex shedding modes are identified behind a disk. To interpret these results, we introduce a model based on the theory of mode interactions in presence of O(2) symmetry. This model, which was initially developed for the Taylor-Couette system, allows us to explain the structural differences observed in the evolution of the two types of wakes and to accurately predict the evolution of the lift force. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Small flexible bodies are observed to hover in an oscillating air column. The air is driven by a large speaker at frequencies in the range 10-65 Hz at amplitudes 1-5 cm. The bodies are made of stiffened tissue paper, bent to form an array of four wings, symmetric about a vertical axis. The flapping of the wings, driven by the oscillating flow, leads to stable hovering. The hovering position of the body is unstable under free fall in the absence of the airflow. Measurements of the minimum flow amplitude as a function of flow frequency were performed for a range of self-similar bodies of the same material. The optimal frequency for hovering is found to vary inversely with the size. We suggest, on the basis of flow visualization, that hovering of such bodies in an oscillating flow depends upon a process of vortex shedding closely analogous to that of an active flapper in otherwise still air. A simple inviscid model is developed illustrating some of the observed properties of flexible passive hoverers at high Reynolds number. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The goal of the research described in this paper is to identify the most suitable generator type for this application.

The paper also proposes a new transverse-flux PM (TFPM) generator topology that could be suitable for this application.

abstract = {In contrast to common continuous wings, microscopic flying insects such as fairyfly and thrips possess extraordinary wings that comprise several bristles. In the low-Reynolds-number environment inhabited by these insects, a bristled wing benefits from the formation of virtual fluid barriers that prevent flow leakage in the gaps of bristles. In this study, the optimal configuration regarding the aerodynamic performance of simple bristled-wing models is investigated numerically in terms of the Reynolds number and the distance between bristles, which are known to be important parameters for determining the effectiveness of a virtual fluid barrier. Inspired by the inherent characteristics of low-Reynolds-number flow, we provide new insights into the aerodynamics of a bristled wing by using a scaling parameter that combines these two independent parameters: effective gap width. In addition, the force ratio is scaled with the Reynolds number to better characterize the generation of drag and lift by a bristled wing. Despite the Reynolds number and the gap width varying by several orders of magnitude, the scaled drag force converges asymptotically beyond a specific effective gap width, and the lift force ratio has a peak within a very narrow range of the effective gap width. The trend of the lift with the effective gap width is correlated with changes in the asymmetric distributions of pressure and vorticity on the surface of the bristles. In addition, the drag and lift predicted theoretically, by invoking the linear superposition of creeping flows, agree well with numerical results, in particular for large effective gap width.},

abstract = {Compliant walls offer the tantalising possibility of passive flow control. This paper examines the mechanics of compliant surfaces driven by wall shear stresses, with solely in-plane velocity response. We present direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flows at low and intermediate Reynolds numbers. In-plane spanwise and streamwise active controls proposed by Choi et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 262, 1994, pp. 75-110) are revisited in order to characterise beneficial wall fluctuations. An analytical framework is then used to map the parameter space of the proposed compliant surfaces. The direct numerical simulations show that large-scale passive streamwise wall fluctuations can reduce friction drag by at least , whereas even small-scale passive spanwise wall motions lead to considerable drag penalty. It is found that a well-designed compliant wall can theoretically exploit the drag-reduction mechanism of an active control; this may help advance the development of practical active and passive control strategies for turbulent friction drag reduction.},

abstract = {Part 2 of this two-part paper provides an example case study following the recently developed comprehensive verification and validation approach presented in Part 1. The case study is for a RANS simulation of an established benchmark for ship hydrodynamics using a ship hydrodynamics CFD code. Verification of the resistance (integral variable) and wave profile (point variable) indicates iterative uncertainties much less than grid uncertainties and simulation numerical uncertainties of about 2{\%}S1(S1is the simulation value for the finest grid). Validation of the resistance and wave profile shows modeling errors of about 8{\%}D (D is the measured resistance) and 6{\%}$\zeta$max($\zeta$maxis the maximum wave elevation), which should be addressed for possible validation at the 3{\%}D and 4{\%}$\zeta$maxlevels. Reducing the level of validation primarily requires reduction in experimental uncertainties. The reduction of both modeling errors and experimental uncertainties will produce verified and validated solutions at low levels for this application using the present CFD code. Although there are many issues for practical applications, the methodology and procedures are shown to be successful for assessing levels of verification and validation and identifying modeling errors in some cases. For practical applications, solutions are far from the asymptotic range; therefore, analysis and interpretation of the results are shown to be important in assessing variability for order of accuracy, levels of verification, and strategies for reducing numerical and modeling errors and uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2001 by ASME.},

The flatness of the investigated objects is classified by the aspect ratio defined as $\chi$= d/a for spheroids (with d the diameter and a the length of the polar axis) and as = d/h) for cylinders (with h the cylinder height). We find a significant qualitative similarity between both configurations. At large aspect ratios ($\chi${\textgreater} 2.3 for spheroids and $\chi$≥4 for cylinders), the secondary bifurcation giving rise to a periodic state without planar symmetry is subcritical with a hysteresis interval of about two Reynolds number units. For spheroids, the sphere-like scenario is recovered only at aspect ratios very close to one ($\chi$≤1 are considered), while for cylindrical bodies the same holds for $\chi$≥1.7. For intermediate aspect ratios, a domain of states with non-zero net helicity separates states typical for the sphere wake from those of an infinitely flat disk. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Added mass characterises the additional force required to accelerate a body when immersed in an ideal fluid. It originates from an asymmetric change to the surrounding pressure field so the fluid velocity satisfies the no-through-flow condition. This is intrinsically linked with the production of boundary vorticity. A body in potential flow may be represented by an inviscid vortex sheet and added-mass forces determined using impulse methods. However, most fluids are not inviscid. It has been theorised that viscosity causes the 'added-mass vorticity' to form in an intensely concentrated boundary layer region, equivalent to the inviscid distribution. Experimentally this is difficult to confirm due to limited measurement resolution and the presence of additional boundary layer vorticity, some the result of induced velocities from free vorticity in the flow field. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to isolate the added-mass vorticity experimentally with particle image velocimetry, and confirm that it agrees with potential flow theory even in separated flows. Experiments on a flat-plate wing undergoing linear and angular acceleration show close agreement between the theoretical and measured added-mass vorticity distributions. This is demonstrated to be independent of changes to flow topology due to flow separation. Flow field impulse and net force are also consistent with theory. This paper provides missing experimental evidence coupling added mass and the production of boundary layer vorticity, as well as confirmation that inviscid unsteady flow theory describes the added-mass effect correctly even in well-developed viscous flows.},

abstract = {Flapping insects are remarkably agile fliers, adapted to a highly turbulent environment. We present a series of high-resolution numerical simulations of a bumblebee interacting with turbulent inflow. We consider both tethered and free flight, the latter with all six degrees of freedom coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations. To this end, we vary the characteristics of the turbulent inflow, either changing the turbulence intensity or the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Active control is excluded in order to quantify the passive response real animals exhibit during their reaction time delay, before the wing beat can be adapted. Modifying the turbulence intensity shows no significant impact on the cycle-averaged aerodynamical forces, moments, and power, compared to laminar inflow conditions. The fluctuations of aerodynamic observables, however, significantly grow with increasing turbulence intensity. Changing the integral scale of turbulent perturbations, while keeping the turbulence intensity fixed, shows that the fluctuation level of forces and moments is significantly reduced if the integral scale is smaller than the wing length. Our study shows that the scale-dependent energy distribution in the surrounding turbulent flow is a relevant factor conditioning how flying insects control their body orientation.},

abstract = {The vortex structures in the wake of 2D elliptical cylinders at low Reynolds numbers are investigated for a Reynolds numbers range of 75 to 175 using direct numerical simulation. By varying the aspect ratio of an elliptical cylinder, the geometry is varied between the extremes of a circular cylinder and a flat plate normal to the flow. The power spectrum analysis of the vertical velocity along the horizontal centreline shows the presence of secondary and tertiary frequencies in the far region of the wake. As the Reynolds number is increased and/or the aspect ratio is decreased, the lower frequencies in the far wake become more dominant and their inception point occurs closer to the elliptical cylinder. This research suggests that the low frequency unsteadiness behind normal flat plates does not need to be due to the vortex interaction, but, rather, can result from the presence of a two-dimensional instability of the mean wake. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier SAS.

Many of the questions regarding wake vortex dynamics from the earlier review have now been answered in the literature, and perhaps an essential key to our new understandings (and indeed to new questions) has been the recent focus, over the past eight years, on the three-dimensional aspects of nominally two-dimensional wake flows. New techniques in experiment, using laser-induced fluorescence and PIV (Particle-Image-Velocimetry), are vigorously being applied to wakes, but interestingly, several of the new discoveries have come from careful use of classical methods. There is no question that strides forward in understanding of the wake problem are being made possible by ongoing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, as well as by the surprisingly successful use of analytical modeling in these flows, and by secondary stability analyses. These new developments, and the discoveries of several new phenomena in wakes, are presented in this review.},

abstract = {This article presents a two-dimensional steady viscous flow simulation past circular and square cylinders at low Reynolds numbers (based on the diameter) by the finite volume method with a non-orthogonal body-fitted grid. Diffusive fluxes are discretized using central differencing scheme, and for convective fluxes upwind and central differencing schemes are blended using a 'deferred correction' approach. A simplified pressure correction equation is derived, and proper under-relaxation factors are used so that computational cost is reduced without adversely affecting the convergence rate. The governing equations are expressed in Cartesian velocity components and solution is carried out using the SIMPLE algorithm for collocated arrangement of variables. The mesh yielding grid-independent solution is then utilized to study, for the very first time, the effect of the Reynolds number on the separation bubble length, separation angle, and drag coefficients for both circular and square cylinders. Finally, functional relationships between the computed quantities and Reynolds number (Re) are proposed up to Re = 40. It is found that circular cylinder separation commences between Re= 6.5-6.6, and the bubble length, separation angle, total drag vary as Re, Re-0.5, Re-0.5 respectively. Extrapolated results obtained from the empirical relations for the circular cylinder show an excellent agreement with established data from the literature. For a square cylinder, the bubble length and total drag are found to vary as Re and Re-0.666, and are greater than these for a circular cylinder at a given Reynolds number. The numerical results substantiate that a square shaped cylinder is more bluff than a circular one.},

abstract = {A dead fish is propelled upstream when its flexible body resonates with oncoming vortices formed in the wake of a bluff cylinder, despite being well outside the suction region of the cylinder. Within this passive propulsion mode, the body of the fish extracts sufficient energy from the oncoming vortices to develop thrust to overcome its own drag. In a similar turbulent wake and at roughly the same distance behind a bluff cylinder, a passively mounted high-aspect-ratio foil is also shown to propel itself upstream employing a similar flow energy extraction mechanism. In this case, mechanical energy is extracted from the flow at the same time that thrust is produced. These results prove experimentally that, under proper conditions, a body can follow at a distance or even catch up to another upstream body without expending any energy of its own. This observation is also significant in the development of low-drag energy harvesting devices, and in the energetics of fish dwelling in flowing water and swimming behind wake-forming obstacles. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

Even for the well-studied case of pipe flow, it has not been possible to determine at what Reynolds number the motion will be either persistently turbulent or ultimately laminar. We show that in pipes, turbulence that is transient at low Reynolds numbers becomes sustained at a distinct critical point. Through extensive experiments and computer simulations, we were able to identify and characterize the processes ultimately responsible for sustaining turbulence. In contrast to the classical Landau-Ruelle-Takens view that turbulence arises from an increase in the temporal complexity of fluid motion, here, spatial proliferation of chaotic domains is the decisive process and intrinsic to the nature of fluid turbulence.},

abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of an airfoil at Reynolds number Re=10,000 constrained by two springs and subject to a uniform oncoming flow is studied numerically. The studies are carried out using open source computational fluid dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM. Under certain conditions related to aerodynamic flutter, this two-degree-of-freedom system undergoes self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs) with potential application as an energy harvester. When the system is given a small initial perturbation, it is seen that the response of the system decays to zero at flow velocities below the flutter velocity, or oscillates in a limit cycle at velocities greater than the flutter velocity. The flutter velocity at Re=10,000 is shown to deviate significantly from the theoretical prediction (which is derived with an assumption of infinite Reynolds number) owing to the effect of viscosity. The LCOs at freestream velocities higher than the flutter velocity result in unsteady flows that are heavily influenced by leading-edge vortex shedding as well as trailing-edge flow separation. The influence of different system parameters on the onset of flutter and on the limit-cycle response characteristics is investigated in this research. This is done by defining a baseline case and examining the effects of varying aerodynamic parameters such as freestream velocity, and structural parameters such as the pitch-to-plunge frequency ratio and the type of spring stiffnesses. The conditions corresponding to the lowest flutter velocities (and consequently the lowest “cut-in” speeds for power extraction) and the parameter space that provide single-period, single-amplitude and harmonic LCOs (ideal for power extraction) are identified. Calculation of instantaneous and time-averaged power is presented by modeling the extraction of energy through a viscous damper. The highest power coefficients and efficiencies are obtained at velocities just higher than the flutter velocity. Introduction of positive cubic stiffening in the system springs is seen to make the system more stable, LCOs more harmonic and single-period, and to potentially increase power extraction efficiency of the system.},

@article{Ledda2018,
abstract = {Although the stability properties of the wake past impervious bluff bodies have been widely examined in the literature, similar analyses regarding the flow around and through porous ones are still lacking. In this work, the effect of the porosity and permeability on the wake patterns of porous rectangular cylinders is numerically investigated at low to moderate Reynolds numbers in the framework of numerical simulation combined with local and global stability analyses. A modified Darcy-Brinkman formulation is employed here so as to describe the flow behavior inside the porous media, where also the convective terms are retained to correctly account for the inertial effects at high values of permeability. Different aspect ratios of the cylinder are considered, varying the thickness-to-height ratios, t/d, from 0.01 (flat plate) to 1.0 (square cylinder). The results show that the permeability of the bodies has a strong effect in modifying the characteristics of the wakes and of the associated flow instabilities, while the porosity weakly affects the resulting flow patterns. In particular, the fluid flows through the porous bodies and, thus, as the permeability is progressively increased, the recirculation regions, initially attached to the rear part of the bodies, at first detach from the body and, eventually, disappear even in the near wakes. Global stability analyses lead to the identification of critical values of the permeability above which any linear instability is prevented. Moreover, a different scaling of the nondimensional permeability allows us to identify a general threshold for all the configurations here studied that ensures the suppression of vortex shedding, at least in the considered parameter space.},

abstract = {While researches have focused on drag reduction of various coated surfaces such as superhydrophobic structures and polymer brushes, the insights tso understand the fundamental physics of the laminar skin friction coefficient and the related drag reduction due to the formation of finite velocity at porous surfaces is still relatively unknown. Herein, we quantitatively investigated the flow over a porous medium by developing a framework to model flow of a Newtonian fluid in a channel where the lower surface was replaced by various porous media. We showed that the flow drag reduction induced by the presence of the porous media depends on the values of the permeability parameter $\alpha$ = L/(MK)1/2 and the height ratio $\delta$ = H/L, where L is the half thickness of the free flow region, H is the thickness and K is the permeability of the fiber layer, and M is the ratio of the fluid effective dynamic viscosity $\mu$e in porous media to its dynamic viscosity $\mu$. We also examined the velocity and shear stress profiles for flow over the permeable layer for the limiting cases of $\alpha$ → 0 and $\alpha$ → ∞. The model predictions were compared with the experimental data for specific porous media and good agreement was found.},

In the present study, some unconventional force expressions based on ‘derivative-moment transformations', which can have a rich variety of forms for the same flow field, are used to provide better insight into local dynamics. In particular, we apply jointly three alternative unconventional force expressions to analyse two numerical solutions of unsteady and viscous circular-cylinder flows.

abstract = {Several tiny insects have peculiar porous wings composed of many bristles and perform an interesting passive flight known as parachuting. Despite numerous studies on the freefall of objects such as disks, the aerodynamic principles of the effects of a bristled configuration on the parachuting motion under external disturbances remain unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate freely falling bristled disks over a wide range of Reynolds numbers by changing the number of bristles and the initial orientation angle and compare their kinematics with those of a full circular disk with no bristles. Given the same diameter and moment of inertia, bristled disks with a smaller area have a steady-state flow field similar to that of a circular disk by virtue of the presence of a fully formed virtual fluid barrier at low-Reynolds numbers. However, in the initial transient phase after release, the bristled disks show different damped oscillatory motions from a circular disk. Regardless of their initial orientation angle, the lateral and angular deviations of the bristled disks are smaller than those of the circular disk, producing a more stable freefall. This trend is also observed even for higher Reynolds numbers, where the bristled wings are known to be ineffective from the perspective of aerodynamic performance. By considering the vorticity fields around the disk, we suggest two vortex-related mechanisms that account for the stable falling of the bristled disk, namely, the formation of more symmetric vortex structures and the location of vortex cores closer to the disk center.},

abstract = {Wind-dispersed plants have evolved ingenious ways to lift their seeds1,2. The common dandelion uses a bundle of drag-enhancing bristles (the pappus) that helps to keep their seeds aloft. This passive flight mechanism is highly effective, enabling seed dispersal over formidable distances3,4; however, the physics underpinning pappus-mediated flight remains unresolved. Here we visualized the flow around dandelion seeds, uncovering an extraordinary type of vortex. This vortex is a ring of recirculating fluid, which is detached owing to the flow passing through the pappus. We hypothesized that the circular disk-like geometry and the porosity of the pappus are the key design features that enable the formation of the separated vortex ring. The porosity gradient was surveyed using microfabricated disks, and a disk with a similar porosity was found to be able to recapitulate the flow behaviour of the pappus. The porosity of the dandelion pappus appears to be tuned precisely to stabilize the vortex, while maximizing aerodynamic loading and minimizing material requirements. The discovery of the separated vortex ring provides evidence of the existence of a new class of fluid behaviour around fluid-immersed bodies that may underlie locomotion, weight reduction and particle retention in biological and manmade structures.},

The effects of the two important parameters, the Reynolds and Darcy numbers, on the flow were investigated in details.

It is also found that, contrary to that of the solid cylinder, the recirculating wake develops downstream of or within the porous cylinder, but not from the surface of it. These new findings provide additional evidence to Leal's conclusion (Leal LG. Vorticity transport and wake structure for bluff bodies at finite Reynolds number.

Also presented in the current study are the variation of the critical Reynolds number for the onset of a recirculating wake as a function of Darcy number and the variation of a newly defined parameter, the penetration depth, as a function of the Reynolds number and Darcy number. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The Reynolds number Re is based on the cylinder diameter and free-stream speed. The results have been presented for 6 ≤ Re ≤ 40 and the blockages between 0.000125 and 0.80. The blockage B is the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the domain width. There is large scatter in the value of Res, reported in the literature, marking the onset of the flow separation. From the present study the Res is found to be 6.29, approximately for B = 0.005. The effect of the blockage on the characteristic flow parameters is found to be insignificant for B ≤ 0.01. The bubble length, separation angle and Res exhibit non-monotonic variation with the blockage. It is for the first time that such a behaviour for the separation angle and Res is being reported. Two types of boundary conditions at the lateral walls have been studied: the slip wall and towing tank. In general for high blockage, the results from the slip boundary condition are closer to the ones for the unbounded flow. In that sense, the use of the slip boundary condition as opposed to the towing tank boundary condition on the lateral walls is advocated. The bubble length, separation angle, base suction, total drag, pressure drag, viscous drag and maximum vorticity on the cylinder surface for the steady flow are found to vary as Re, Re-0.5, Re-1, Re-0.5, Re-0.64, Re-0.60 and Re0.5, respectively. The extrapolated results for the steady flow, for higher Re, are found to match quite well with the other results from the literature. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

The transition from the straight vertical path to the planar fluttering regime is found to exhibit complex dynamics: a bistable behaviour of the system is detected within some parameter range and several intermediate regimes are observed in which, although the wake is unstable, the path barely deviates from vertical. By varying independently the body-to-fluid inertia ratio and the relative magnitude of inertial and viscous effects over a significant range, we set up a comprehensive map of the corresponding styles of path followed by an infinitely thin disk. We observe the four types of planar regimes already reported in experiments but also identify two additional fully three-dimensional regimes in which the body experiences a slow horizontal precession superimposed onto zigzagging or tumbling motions.},

abstract = {We numerically examine the hydrodynamic interaction between a flexible fin and surrounding fluid near the ground when four relevant parameters of initial position, bending rigidity, mass ratio and Reynolds number are varied. The leading edge of the fin is fixed in the streamwise direction, whereas the lateral motion is freely movable by the fluid–flexible body interaction near the ground. When the fin is initially positioned far from the ground, the fin passively migrates toward another wall-normal position near the ground for an equilibrium state due to larger positive deflection angle for the fin than the negative angle by the effects of vorticity generated by the lateral velocity gradient near the ground. In addition, as the flapping amplitude of the fin is small for large bending rigidity and small mass ratio, the great asymmetry between the positive and negative deflection angles reduces the transient time of the fin to reach the equilibrium position near the ground, and thus the fins can quickly take the hydrodynamic benefits with low drag at an equilibrium state without any energy consumption for lift force due to local balance between the flapping motion and the ground. The most important observation is that the equilibrium position of the fin is invariant to the initial position, bending rigidity and mass ratio of the fin. However, the equilibrium position of the fin is dramatically affected by the Reynolds number. The present results provide new insights into the functional role of the relevant parameters in passively flapping-based locomotion near the ground.},

We determine effective conditions that lead to periodic hovering in terms of two parameters: the flyer's shape (opening angle) and the effort (flow acceleration) needed to keep the flyer aloft. We find optimal shapes that minimize effort. We then examine hovering stability and observe a transition from unstable, yet maneuverable, to stable hovering. Interestingly, this transition occurs at post-optimal shapes, that is, at increased aerodynamic effort. These results have profound implications on the interplay between stability and maneuverability in live organisms as well as on the design of man-made air vehicles.},

abstract = {In this paper we illustrate how the method of volume averaging can be used to derive Darcy's law with the Forchheimer correction for homogeneous porous media. Beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations, we find the volume averaged momentum equation to be given by 〈V$\beta$〉 = -K/$\beta${\textperiodcentered}(▽〈$\rho$$\beta$〉 $\beta$ - $\rho$$\beta$g) - F{\textperiodcentered}〈V$\beta$〉. The Darcy's law permeability tensor, K, and the Forchheimer correction tensor, F, are determined by closure problems that must be solved using a spatially periodic model of a porous medium. When the Reynolds number is small compared to one, the closure problem can be used to prove that F is a linear function of the velocity, and order of magnitude analysis suggests that this linear dependence may persist for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. {\textcopyright} 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Research on unstable airflow in nature has long been an important subject in work on aerodynamics, and most principles of flight have been found in nature. The design of an aircraft requires considering not only the lift required to balance gravity but also the stability of the state of balance during the cruise. Dandelion seeds happen to have a similar flow stability during flight. These seeds have a pore-like disk structure such that when air flows through them, a separated vortex ring is generated above them. Dandelions stabilize the airflow by changing the tip structure of the fluff. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to replace the fluff structure of dandelion seeds with a rigid porous disk structure and numerically simulates the resulting flow model to examine the flight of dandelion seeds. The results show that when the porosity of the disk structure exceeds a threshold, an axisymmetric and stable separated vortex ring is generated. A comparison of the simulation with observations from a wind tunnel experiment showed that the two yielded similar results, which confirms the principle of the model of flight of dandelion seeds. The authors then explore the condition for the separation of the vortex ring and conclude that the change in porosity affects the characteristics of the vortex ring.},

The Reynolds number for stable motion of a disk with large I* is 100, in agreement with the Reynolds number for stability of the wake of a fixed disk.

The laminar wake behind certain of the oscillating disks consisted of a staggered arrangement of two rows of regularly spaced vortex rings similar to the wake observed behind liquid drops by Margarvey and Bishop.

abstract = {The aerodynamics of flapping flight for the smallest insects such as thrips is often characterized by a 'clap and fling' of the wings at the end of the upstroke and the beginning of the downstroke. These insects fly at Reynolds numbers (Re) of the order of 10 or less where viscous effects are significant. Although this wing motion is known to augment the lift generated during flight, the drag required to fling the wings apart at this scale is an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding force acting on a single wing. As the opposing forces acting normal to each wing nearly cancel during the fling, these large forces do not have a clear aerodynamic benefit. If flight efficiency is defined as the ratio of lift to drag, the clap and fling motion dramatically reduces efficiency relative to the case of wings that do not aerodynamically interact. In this paper, the effect of a bristled wing characteristic of many of these insects was investigated using computational fluid dynamics. We performed 2D numerical simulations using a porous version of the immersed boundary method. Given the computational complexity involved in modeling flow through exact descriptions of bristled wings, the wing was modeled as a homogeneous porous layer as a first approximation. High-speed video recordings of free-flying thrips in takeoff flight were captured in the laboratory, and an analysis of the wing kinematics was performed. This information was used for the estimation of input parameters for the simulations. Compared with a solid wing (without bristles), the results of the study show that the porous nature of the wings contributes largely to drag reduction across the Re range explored. The aerodynamic efficiency, calculated as the ratio of lift to drag coefficients, was larger for some porosities when compared with solid wings.},

abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) is central to species expansion following climate change, re-colonization of disturbed areas and control of pests1–8. The current paradigm is that the frequency and spatial extent of LDD events are extremely difficult to predict9–12. Here we show that mechanistic models coupling seed release and aerodynamics with turbulent transport processes provide accurate probabilistic descriptions of LDD of seeds by wind. The proposed model reliably predicts the vertical distribution of dispersed seeds of five tree species observed along a 45-m high tower in an eastern US deciduous forest. Simulations show that uplifting above the forest canopy is necessary and sufficient for LDD, hence, they provide the means to define LDD quantitatively rather than arbitrarily. Seed uplifting probability thus sets an upper bound on the probability of long-distance colonization. Uplifted yellow poplar seeds are on average lighter than seeds at the forest floor, but also include the heaviest seeds. Because uplifting probabilities are appreciable (as much as 1– 5{\%}), and tree seed crops are commonly massive, some LDD events will establish individuals that can critically affect plant dynamics on large scales.},

abstract = {The self-excited global instability mechanisms existing in flat-plate laminar separation bubbles are studied here, in order to shed light on the causes of unsteadiness and three-dimensionality of unforced, nominally two-dimensional separated flows. The presence of two known linear global mechanisms, namely an oscillator behaviour driven by local regions of absolute inflectional instability and a centrifugal instability giving rise to a steady three-dimensionalization of the bubble, is studied in a series of model separation bubbles. These results indicate that absolute instability, and consequently a global oscillator behaviour, does not exist for two-dimensional bubbles with a peak reversed-flow velocity below 12{\%} of the free-stream velocity. However, the three-dimensional instability becomes active for recirculation levels as low as urev ≈ 7{\%}. These findings suggest a route to the three-dimensionality and unsteadiness observed in experiments and simulations substantially different from that usually found in the literature of laminar separation bubbles, in which two-dimensional vortex shedding is followed by three-dimensionalization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

We consider the class of periodic travelling-wave body motions, in the limit of small amplitude. We calculate the output power provided to the body by thrust forces, and the input power done against pressure forces, as functions of the aspect ratio and strength of the vortex street. We then formulate two optimization problems. In the first, we determine the body wave which provides maximum output power for fixed amplitude. We find a closed-form solution with a transition from power law to exponential decay of output power as the vortex street widens. In the second problem, we incorporate internal viscoelasticity to the swimming body and compute its contribution to the input power. We find the body wave which maximizes efficiency for a given output power. The body shape and resulting efficiency are found in closed form and simple approximate formulas are given. We find that efficiency scales as the inverse of the damping parameter. Finally, we compare our results with previous experiments and simulations. We find agreement in some aspects and disagreement in others.

Recently, studies of interactions between the dispersal unit and physical environment have uncovered fluid dynamic mechanisms of seed flight, protective measures against fire, and release mechanisms of explosive dispersers. Although environmental conditions generally dictate dispersal distances, plants are not purely passive players in these processes. Evidence suggests that some plants may enact informed dispersal, where dispersal-related traits are modified according to the environment. This can occur via developmental regulation, but also on shorter timescales via structural remodelling in relation to water availability and temperature. Linking interactions between dispersal mechanisms and environmental conditions will be essential to fully understand population dynamics and distributions.},

abstract = {An efficient numerical method for solving the coupled system of Navier-Stokes equations and equations of motion of a single spherical particle is presented. It combines a spectral - spectral-element spatial discretization in a cylindrical domain moving translationally with the free particle and particle equations of motion involving hydrodynamic forces integrated on the particle surface. The time discretization is semi-implicit with a third-order accurate explicit treatment of the advective terms and a fully implicit treatment of the remaining linear problem consisting in Stokes-like equations coupled with the particle equations of motion. It is shown that the fully implicit approach is the only way to account for very light spheres. Moreover, no reduction of the time step is necessary. The particle equations of motion are re-formulated as a simple system of six linear equations for six unknowns using the fact that the six components combining the hydrodynamic forces and torques depend linearly on particle translation and angular velocities. They are solved directly and are thus exactly satisfied at each time step. Numerical tests show that the increase of computing costs needed to account for the free sphere degrees of freedom remains within about 20{\%} per time step. The accuracy and resolution independence of the solution are tested at the primary instability threshold and for a strongly supercritical zigzagging trajectory. A partial validation using available experimental results is also presented. Very satisfactory accuracy is shown to be obtained with only a very limited number of azimuthal modes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We continue with the 1997 work of Noca et al. and offer some additional closed-form expressions (and their derivations) for the evaluation of time-dependent forces on a body in an incompressible, viscous, and rotational flow, which require only the knowledge of the velocity field (and its derivatives) in a finite and arbitrarily chosen region enclosing the body. In particular, we offer an expression for the force which only depends on the velocity field (and its derivatives) on thesurface of an arbitrary control volume. These expressions are particularly useful for experimental techniques like Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) which provide time sequences of 2-D velocity fields but not pressure fields. For some common flow situations (freely moving objects, flexible bodies, flying and swimming animals, low Reynolds number flows, soap film tunnels), these techniques may be more viable than traditional methods (strain gages). The formulations can also be of some interest to the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) community, especially when pressure is not evaluated explicitly, such as in vorticity-based algorithms. From a theoretical point of view, they provide an explicit relation between loading and flow structure. In the present work, the formulations are tested on a numerical flow simulation using a high-resolution vortex method and experimentally with DPIV on a circular cylinder flow. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Flow around and/or through a honeycomb disk is a common problem encountered in aggregation, filtration and sedimentation processes. Mean flow, turbulent statistics and flow structures behind a solid and a honeycomb disk were experimentally studied by 2D PIV system. The results revealed that the mean flow structure behind a honeycomb disk was quite different from that of the solid disk wake. Due to the extra fluid through the small holes on the disk, the recirculation zone of honeycomb disk was much smaller both in length and in width. Meanwhile, the entrainment of the shear layer was significantly reduced and the length of the wake was increased. As the result, the honeycomb disk drastically decreased the velocity deficit, the rate of velocity recovery. The cross-stream distributions of Reynolds normal stresses exhibited symmetry while Reynolds shear stress showed asymmetry at x/d = 1, 3, 5, respectively. Using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), it was found that, for both solid and honeycomb disk, the instantaneous wake configuration at reflectional-symmetry-breaking (RSB) mode with hairpin vortices periodically shedding could be detected by the first two POD modes. The POD mode 3 consisted of two pairs of contours, showed well plane-symmetric large-scale vortices shedding from the mixing layers region (y = ±0.5D). Due to different wake recovery rate and the interaction between the backflow and the shear layer, mode 4 structures in the both near wakes were obviously different.},

abstract = {Flow-induced vibration (FIV) of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with an attached splitter plate in uniform flow is studied numerically via a stabilized space-time finite element method. The Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter and the free-stream speed is restricted to 150. The ratio of the density of the body to that of the fluid, for the major part of the study, is 10. Two different reduced speeds are defined to quantify the compliance of the elastic support and flexibility of the splitter plate, respectively: Us∗ based on the natural frequency of the spring-mass system and Up∗ based on the fundamental natural frequency of the plate. Flow past a stationary cylinder (Us∗ = 0) with a flexible splitter plate of length is studied at different values of Up∗. The vibration response of the plate exhibits lock-in with various eigenmodes of the plate in different ranges of Up∗. The onsets of these lock-in regions are abrupt and hysteretic. The elastically mounted cylinder, without the splitter plate, undergoes large-amplitude vortex-induced vibration (VIV) for 4 {\textless} Us∗ {\textless} 7. These large-amplitude oscillations are a consequence of synchronization, wherein the vortex shedding frequency locks in to the cylinder oscillation frequency. A rigid splitter plate attached to the cylinder reduces significantly the peak amplitude during VIV. Increasing the length of the plate from to only marginally affects the peak amplitude. It, however, leads to a wider range of lock-in. Unlike the case of an isolated cylinder, the lock-in and desynchronization regimes are not well demarcated in the presence of the splitter plate. Further, galloping is observed beyond a critical value of Us∗; the amplitude of vibration increases with an increase in Us∗ while the vibration frequency is relatively low and remains nearly constant. Increase in plate length delays, in terms of Us∗, the onset of galloping. It is also found that the flexibility of the plate affects the maximum oscillation amplitude in the VIV regime. It also dictates the presence/absence of galloping. The system behaves similar to an isolated cylinder for a very flexible plate. The response is devoid of galloping, but relatively large amplitude of oscillation is observed during lock-in. The behaviour of the cylinder with a stiff plate is similar to that with the rigid one. The galloping instability sets in when the flexibility of the plate is less than a certain value (Up∗ {\textless} 4.7, approximately for Us∗ = 22). The VIV and galloping are separated by a range of Us∗ in which the flow is either steady, for longer plates, or exhibits very weak vortex shedding. In the VIV regime, the plate tip and cylinder vibrate in phase for low Up∗; their motion is out of phase for larger Up∗. The change in phase is also associated with change in the frequency of vibration. At low Up∗, the frequency of vibration is close to the first natural frequency of the system, while at high it Up∗ becomes closer to the second natural frequency. The vibration amplitude of the cylinder is close to maximum in the VIV regime for Us∗ = 6. Computations for various Up∗, for Us∗ = 6 and 22, are utilized to determine optimal flexibility that leads to minimal FIV. The effect of the length of the flexible splitter plate, mass ratio and damping ratio is studied. A strategy is proposed to utilize the computations from various combinations of Us∗ and Up∗ to choose the appropriate flexibility of the attached splitter plate to minimize FIV.},

The interaction between the flexible body and its surrounding vortices is investigated. A modified immersed boundary method is used to solve the motion of fluid, integrated with a linearized Euler-Bernoulli beam model to govern the motion of the flexible plate. Results show that, when the distance between cylinder and plate is small, the surface of the plate is surrounded by vortices layers and the plate oscillates periodically, with amplitude similar to the cylinder movement. However, if the distance becomes large, we find that the vortices are shed from the D-cylinder in front of the plate, and the incoming vortices make the plate oscillate with large amplitude at the beginning and then slant laterally. Also, the amplitude becomes smaller compared to the case of the small distance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

@article{Limacher2018,
abstract = {The concept of added mass arises from potential flow analysis and is associated with the acceleration of a body in an inviscid irrotational fluid. When shed vorticity is modeled as vortex singularities embedded in this irrotational flow, the associated force can be superimposed onto the added-mass force due to the linearity of the governing Laplace equation. This decomposition of force into added-mass and circulatory components remains common in modern aerodynamic models, but its applicability to viscous separated flows remains unclear. The present work addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a generalized derivation of the added-mass and circulatory force decomposition which is valid for a body of arbitrary shape in an unbounded, incompressible fluid domain, in both two and three dimensions, undergoing arbitrary motions amid continuous distributions of vorticity. From the general expression, the classical added-mass force is rederived for well-known canonical cases and is seen to be additive to the circulatory force for any flow. The formulation is shown to be equivalent to existing theoretical work under the specific conditions and assumptions of previous studies. It is also validated using a numerical simulation of a pitching plate in a steady freestream flow, conducted by Wang and Eldredge [Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 27, 577 (2013)TCFDEP0935-496410.1007/s00162-012-0279-5]. In response to persistent confusion in the literature, a discussion of the most appropriate physical interpretation of added mass is included, informed by inspection of the derived equations. The added-mass force is seen to account for the dynamic effect of near-body vorticity and is not (as is commonly claimed) associated with the acceleration of near-body fluid which "must" somehow move with the body. Various other consequences of the derivation are discussed, including a concept which has been labeled the conservation of image-vorticity impulse.},

The drag of such passive airborne platforms is of significant interest in a number of modern aerodynamics applications including, for example, dispersion of "smart dust" carrying various chemical and thermal sensors, dispersion of seeds, as well as movement of small organisms with bristle appendages. In the present work, drag is measured using the free fall method supplemented by extensive flow visualization. The effects of platform weight, average nano-fiber diameter, and porosity of the nonwoven mats on the drag force are studied. The results are compared to data for the corresponding impermeable structures that are covered with plastic wrap. The data are presented in the form of standard dependencies of drag coefficient on the Reynolds number of the structure. It was found that permeable platforms with holes on the order of several microns (which is about ten times the diameter of the nanofibers) are essentially impermeable for airflow.},

Here, we attach the -shaped flyer at its apex in oscillating flow, allowing it to rotate freely akin to a pendulum. We use computational vortex sheet methods and we develop a quasi-steady point-force model to analyse the rotational dynamics of the flyer. We find that the flyer exhibits stable concave-down and concave-up behaviour. Importantly, the down and up configurations are bistable and co-exist for a range of background flow properties. We explain the aerodynamic origin of this bistability and compare it to the inertia-induced stability of an inverted pendulum oscillating at its base. We then allow the flyer to flap passively by introducing a rotational spring at its apex. For stiff springs, flexibility diminishes upward stability but as stiffness decreases, a new transition to upward stability is induced by flapping. We conclude by commenting on the implications of these findings for biological and man-made aircraft.},

abstract = {We investigated experimentally the dynamics of the three-dimensional secondary instability developing in the wake of a thin flat plate at moderate Reynolds numbers. The wake is formed as the two laminar boundary layers developing on each side merge at the trailing edge of the flat plate. Both the spatial and temporal evolution of the two- and three-dimensional instabilities are analysed by means of laser-induced visualizations of the deformation of the interface separating the two streams. It was found that although the wake may exhibit two distinct three-dimensional modes with different symmetry characteristics, Modes 1 and 2 (Lasheras {\&} Meiburg 1990), the latter appears to be amplified first, thereafter dominating the evolution of the near wake. By varying the forcing frequency of the primary two-dimensional instability, we found that the wavelength of the three-dimensional mode is selected by the wavelength of the two-dimensional K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortices, with a ratio ($\lambda$3D/$\lambda$2D) of order one. In the far-wake region, both modes appear to grow and co-exist. Furthermore, by analysing the response of the wake to spanwise-periodic and impulsive perturbations applied at the trailing edge of the plate, we demonstrate that the nature of the secondary instability of the wake behind a thin flat plate is convective. In addition, both modes are shown to have comparable wavelengths and to be the result of the same instability mechanism.},

abstract = {How do the laws of physics change with changes in spatial dimension? Maybe not at all in some cases, but in important cases, the changes are dramatic. Fluid turbulence-the fluctuating, intermittent and many-degree-of-freedom state of a highly forced fluid-determines the transport of heat, mass and momentum and is ubiquitous in nature, where turbulence is found on spatial scales from microns to millions of kilometres (turbulence in stars) and beyond (galactic events such as supernovae). When the turbulent degrees of freedom are suppressed in one spatial dimension, the resulting turbulent state in two dimensions (2D) is remarkably changed compared with the turbulence in three dimensions (3D)-energy flows to small scales in 3D but towards large scales in 2D. Although this result has been known since the 1960s due to the pioneering work of Kraichnan, Batchelor and Leith, how one transitions between 3D and 2D turbulence has remained remarkably unexplored. For real physical systems, this is a highly significant question with important implications about transport in geophysical systems that determine weather on short time scales and climate on longer scales. Is the transition from 3D to 2D smooth or are there sharp transitions that signal a threshold of the dominance of one type of turbulence over another? Recent results by Benavides and Alexakis (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 822 (2017), pp. 364-385) suggest that the latter may be the case- A surprising and provocative discovery.},

We first study the flow generated by only one rotating bumblebee wing in circular motion with 45 angle of attack. We then consider a model bumblebee flying in a numerical wind tunnel, which is tethered and has rigid wings flapping with a prescribed generic motion. The inflow condition of the wind varies from laminar to strongly turbulent regimes. Massively parallel simulations show that inflow turbulence does not significantly alter the wings' leading edge vortex, which enhances lift production. Finally, we focus on studying the helicity of the generated vortices and analyze their contribution at different scales using orthogonal wavelets.},

abstract = {The flow past a circular cylinder at a low Reynolds number (40 ≤ Re ≤ 180) is investigated. A stabilized finite element method is utilized to solve the incompressible flow equations in two-dimensions. The critical Re for the onset of vortex shedding (Rec) is estimated to be 46.985. The variation of time-averaged coefficient of drag (CD) with Re is found to be non-monotonic for Re {\textgreater} Rec. Unlike for the steady flow, the pressure component of CD increases with an increase in Re in a short range of Re for Re {\textgreater} Rec. This increase is due to a significant rise in the peak suction, near the shoulder of the cylinder, of the time-averaged flow, with Re. Several definitions of vortex formation length (Lf), proposed in the past, are reviewed and compared. A new definition, based on the fluctuation in the local kinetic energy of the flow, is proposed. The variation of Lf with Re is compared with Lw, the separation bubble length. Lf is found to be significantly larger than Lw for Re close to Rec. The difference between the two lengths decreases with an increase in Re. The meaning of Lf, in terms of flow physics, is explored. It is found that the vortices form in the near wake, even for Re close to Rec. They become stronger as they convect downstream and gain full strength at a location Lf downstream of the cylinder, beyond which they begin to decay.},

abstract = {A direct-forcing fictitious domain method is employed to study the dynamics of an open triangle in a vertically oscillatory flow. The flow structures, the vertical force and the torque on the fixed body are analysed for the stable flow regime in which the flow structures form and evolve exactly in the same way in each period and the unstable regime, respectively. Our results indicate that in the stable flow regime for the body with upright orientation, the steady streaming structure mainly comprises two vortex pairs located respectively above and below the body. Due to up-down asymmetry of the body, the pair below the body produces a larger vertical force on the body than the upper pair, which is mainly responsible for the non-zero average force at relatively high Reynolds numbers. The average force increases with increasing Reynolds number or increasing dimensionless period for the parameter range studied, due to the vortex effects. In the unstable regime, a vortex pair is ejected downward from each body edge. The irregular motion of the emitted vortices below the body leads to the irregular fluctuation of the vertical force. Regarding the torque on a tilted body, in the stable regime, the body experiences a restoring torque when its vertex angle is larger than a critical value being close to (and smaller than) 60°, and otherwise a destructive torque, irrespective of the value of tilt angle. For a fixed vertex angle, the torque magnitude is largest when the tilt angle is around 45°. In the unstable regime, the persistent ejection of the vortex pair during upward flow and corresponding restoring torque are observed for a large tilt angle with one edge aligned close to the horizontal direction, as in the experiment of Liu et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 108, 2012, 068103). For a relatively small tilt angle, the emission direction of the vortex pair has intermittency, leading to the intermittency in the direction of torque. The reasons for the above observations are discussed. The predictions on the stable orientation for a hovering body in the stable flow regime and the irregular orientation in the unstable regime are confirmed in the dynamic simulation of a freely moving body. The body with the stable horizontal orientation in case of small vertex angle migrates along the body-shape-diverging direction.},

abstract = {We present a new computational fluid dynamics approach for simulating two-phase flow in hybrid systems containing solid-free regions and deformable porous matrices. Our approach is based on the derivation of a unique set of volume-averaged partial differential equations that asymptotically approach the Navier-Stokes Volume-of-Fluid equations in solid-free regions and multiphase Biot Theory in porous regions. The resulting equations extend our recently developed Darcy-Brinkman-Biot framework to multiphase flow. Through careful consideration of interfacial dynamics (relative permeability and capillary effects) and extensive benchmarking, we show that the resulting model accurately captures the strong two-way coupling that is often exhibited between multiple fluids and deformable porous media. Thus, it can be used to represent flow-induced material deformation (swelling, compression) and failure (cracking, fracturing). The model's open-source numerical implementation, hybridBiotInterFoam, effectively marks the extension of computational fluid mechanics into modeling multiscale multiphase flow in deformable porous systems. The versatility of the solver is illustrated through applications related to material failure in poroelastic coastal barriers and surface deformation due to fluid injection in poro-visco-plastic systems.},

abstract = {The behavior of a self-propelled flexible fin behind a circular cylinder in a uniform flow was explored using the immersed boundary method. The transverse heaving motion of the leading edge of the fin was prescribed, whereas the lateral behavior was spontaneously determined by the hydrodynamic interactions between the fin and the fluid environment. Three different behaviors were observed: propulsion upstream, drift downstream, and holding stationary at an equilibrium position. In a uniform flow, the fin could not overcome the positive net drag, and it drifted downstream. By contrast, a fin in the wake of a cylinder was propelled toward the circular cylinder during the heaving motion. The trailing edge of the fin passively fluttered along the oncoming vortices, thereby propelling the fin upstream. During the upstream propulsion behavior, the fin was propelled through the vortex cores. The fin was observed to remain stationary at a heaving frequency equal to the vortex shedding frequency, and a slaloming behavior was observed between the oncoming vortical structures. The fin was not propelled toward the cylinder during the slaloming behavior; rather, it lingered at a certain streamwise distance from the cylinder. Several equilibrium positions were dynamically determined from the interaction between the fin and the vortical fluid environment. The equilibrium position depended on the initial longitudinal position and the phase of the fin heaving motion with respect to the phase of the vortex shedding. The power input required to drive the heaving motion was reduced during the slaloming behavior.},

abstract = {Vortex shedding is an interesting phenomenon and a fundamental problem when it comes to flow across bluff bodies. Generation of vortices behind a porous bluff body is further compelling to study. In this paper, a numerical investigation on the onset of vortex shedding behind a porous square cylinder is presented for 41≤Re≤50 and the computations are performed for different values of permeability (Darcy number, Da = 10-6-10-2) and porosity ($\epsilon$ = 0.629−0.993). Besides, an outlook on unsteady flow across the permeable cylinder is provided for Re=50−150. The numerical simulations are performed by modifying pimpleFoam solver of OpenFOAM 4.1 coupled with Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model, using a single domain approach. Current study provides an insight on the influence of permeability on the initiation of vortex shedding behind the porous bluff body. A brief discussion is provided on the jump in flow characteristics, at intermediate values of Darcy number, comparing square with other bluff shapes. Also, a correlation for the frequency of vortex shedding is given in terms of the flow and material parameters. Optimistically, scholars and engineers working on flow control using porous media will benefit from the information presented in this article.},

abstract = {Fluid flow at the interface of a porous medium and an open channel is the governing phenomenon in a number of processes of industrial importance. Traditionally, this has been modeled by applying the Brinkman's modification of Darcy's law to obtain the velocity profile in terms of an additional parameter known as the "apparent viscosity" or the "slip coefficient". To test this ad hoc approach, a detailed experimental investigation of the flow was conducted using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) in the close vicinity of the permeable boundary of a porous medium. The porous medium used in the experiments consisted of a network of continuous glass strands woven together in a random fashion. A Hele-Shaw cell was partially filled with a fibrous preform such that an open channel flow is coupled with the Darcy flow inside the preform through the permeable interface of the preform. The open channel portion of the Hele-Shaw cell also acts as an ideal porous medium of known in-plane permeability which is much higher than the permeability of the fibrous porous medium. A viscous fluid is injected at a constant flow rate through the above arrangement and a saturated and steady flow is established through the cell. Using LDA, steady state velocity profiles are accurately measured by traversing across the cell in the direction perpendicular to the flow. A series of experiments were conducted in which fluid viscosity, flow rate, solid volume fraction of the porous medium and depth of the Hele-Shaw cell were varied. For each and every case in which the conditions for Hele-Shaw approximation were valid, the depth of the boundary layer zone or the screening length inside the fibrous preform was found to be of the order of the channel depth. This is much larger as compared to the Brinkman's prediction of the screening length which is of the order of √K, where K is the permeability of the fibrous porous medium. Based on this finding, we modified the boundary condition in the Brinkman's solution and found that the velocity profile results compared well with the experimental data for the planar geometry and the fibrous preforms for volume fractions of 7{\%}, 14{\%} and 21{\%} for Hele-Shaw cell depths of 1.6 and 3.175 mm. For a cell depth of 4.8 cm, in which the Hele-Shaw approximation was not valid, the boundary layer thickness or the screening length was found to be less than the mold or channel depth but was still much larger than the Brinkman's prediction.},

It is shown that the lift slope coefficient uniformly decreases with increasing permeability, changing from the familiar value of 2$\pi$ to 2$\pi$ times the relative width of the forward part. Concurrently, the aerodynamic center moves from its familiar position at the quarter-chord point of the wing to the quarter-chord point of the forward part, but its movement is not uniform.

abstract = {Coupling offshore wind with hydrogen production can leverage the growth of both technologies due to synergies related to high capacity factors and the possibility of taking wind farms to areas where it would be impossible if these had to be connected to land. This work studies the competitiveness of different pathways of exporting hydrogen from offshore production plants, with special focus on the offloading to export hydrogen (pure hydrogen or hydrogen carriers) to land. This analysis relies on a techno-economic assessment of these pathways, including the determination of their levelized cost of hydrogen, the net present value and their energy expenditure. Among the studied pathways, the use of pipelines to transport hydrogen presents as the best solution, providing a levelized cost of hydrogen of 5.35 €/kgH2 for the baseline case, with the potential of being as low as 2.17 €/kgH2 if the EU support to hydrogen deployment achieves its targets. The energy requirement for this pathway is 0.46 MWh/MWhH2 (of lower heating value), being one of the less energy intensive methods. Another key insight of this work is that the commercialization of produced oxygen improves greatly the viability of the project, increasing the net present value by more than 150 M€ without major added complexities in the infrastructure. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to different variables (electrolyzer cost, capacity factor, electrolyzer system efficiency, plant distance to shore and the levelized cost of electricity) showing that the levelized cost of hydrogen is very dependent on the electricity and electrolyzer costs.},

abstract = {The origin of the secondary vortex street, observed in the far wake in the flow past a circular cylinder, is investigated. The Reynolds number, based on the diameter of the cylinder, is 150. The von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street, which originates in the near wake, decays exponentially downstream of the cylinder. Beyond the region of decay, a broad band of frequencies are selectively amplified, leading to the formation of a secondary vortex street consisting of packets of large-scale vortex structures. The streamwise location of the onset of the instability, frequency of the generation of packets and their convection speed are estimated via direct numerical simulation (DNS). Global linear stability analysis of the time-averaged flow reveals the presence of unstable convective modes that travel at almost the same speed and have a structure similar to the packet-like disturbances as observed in the DNS. Sensitivity analysis of the global convective modes to structural perturbations is carried out to locate the region of the wake that is most significant in generating the modes responsible for the appearance of the secondary vortex street. This information is utilized to control the flow. By placing a 'slip' splitter plate along the wake centre line, in the overlap region of the direct and the adjoint modes, the oscillations in the far wake are significantly reduced, though the oscillations related to the primary vortex shedding in the near wake are not. It is also found that suppression of the primary vortex shedding leads to annihilation of the secondary vortex street as well. Linear stability analysis of the steady-state flow does not yield any modes that can explain the appearance of the secondary vortex street. The steady and time-averaged wake profiles, for the Re D 150 flow, are compared to bring out the differences in the two. The effect of free-stream oscillations on the evolution of the secondary vortex street is investigated. By reducing the amplitude of inlet excitation, a gradual transition from ordered shedding in the far wake to the appearance of a broad-band spectrum of frequencies, as in the unforced wake, is observed.

We find that when the amplitude of the airflow is above a threshold, the net lift exceeds the weight and the object starts to hover.

abstract = {This work analyzes the porosity effects on laminar flow and drag reduction of Newtonian fluids flowing over and through permeable surfaces. A fully developed laminar flow in a channel partially replaced with a porous material is considered. The analytical solutions for the velocity and shear stress are given and examined to identify the influence of the porosity on the flow. The scaling laws in the porous media are determined using asymptotic analysis in the limit of infinitely small permeability. Direct numerical simulations are performed and the transport equation for the kinetic energy is examined to establish the dependency of the porosity on the flow. We found that the impact of the porosity depends on the permeability. For high permeability, the higher porosity induces the increase of driving force and accelerates the flow while it decelerates the flow for low permeability by causing stronger viscous drag of the porous medium.},

This work identifies the pulse-jet propulsion mode used by these animals as a coupled mass-spring-mass oscillator, enabling the design of a flexible self-propelled robot. We use this system to experimentally demonstrate that resonance greatly benefits pulse-jet swimming speed and efficiency, and the robot's optimal cost of transport is found to match that of the most efficient biological swimmers in nature, such as the jellyfish Aurelia aurita . The robot also exhibits a preferred Strouhal number for efficient swimming, thereby bridging the gap between pulse-jet propulsion and established findings in efficient fish swimming. Extensions of the current robotic framework to larger amplitude oscillations could combine resonance effects with optimal vortex formation to further increase propulsive performance and potentially outperform biological swimmers altogether. },

abstract = {Laminar separation bubbles generated on a flat plate by an adverse pressure gradient are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). Two-dimensional periodic forcing is applied at a blowing/suction slot upstream of separation. Control of separation through forcing with various frequencies and amplitudes is examined. For the investigation of absolute instability mechanisms, baseflows provided by two-dimensional Navier-Stokes calculations are analysed by introducing pulse disturbances and computing the three-dimensional flow response using DNS. The primary instability of the time-averaged flow is investigated with a local linear stability analysis. Employing a steady flow solution as baseflow, the nonlinear and non-parallel effects on the self-sustained disturbance development are illustrated, and a feedback mechanism facilitated by the upstream flow deformation is identified. Secondary instability is investigated locally using spatially periodic baseflows. The flow response to pulsed forcing indicates the existence of an absolute secondary instability mechanism, and the results indicate that this mechanism is dependent on the periodic forcing. Results from three-dimensional DNS provide insight into the global instability mechanisms of separation bubbles and complement the local analysis. A forcing strategy was devised that suppresses the temporal growth of three-dimensional disturbances, and as a consequence, breakdown to turbulence does not occur. Even for a separation bubble that has transitioned to turbulence, the flow relaminarizes when applying two-dimensional periodic forcing with proper frequencies and amplitudes.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic performances of a fishlike undulating foil in the wake of a D-section cylinder are numerically investigated by using a modified immersed boundary method. The results regarding the effects of various controlling parameters, including the distance between the foil and the D-cylinder, the frequency and the phase angle of foil's undulation, and the phase angle of heaving motion on the thrust and the input power, are reported. It is observed that the foil without undulation in the vortex street can gain a thrust, as a result of the fact that the passing vortices produce reverse flows with respect to the mainstream in vicinity of the foil surface. When an undulating foil is placed at different distances behind the D-section cylinder, different wake structures form behind the cylinder. The wake area can be divided into three domains: suction domain, thrust enhancing domain, and weak influence domain. The undulation of the foil can inhibit the roll-up instability of the shear layers and vortex shedding from the cylinder and consequently significantly enlarge the suction domain, compared to the foil-free case or the stationary foil case. The thrust on the foil first increases and then decreases, as the distance between the foil and the cylinder increases. The undulation plays a negative role in the foil propulsion when the foil is located near the cylinder (largely in the suction domain) and a positive role when the distance between the foil and the cylinder is beyond a critical value. The mean thrusts do not vary significantly with the undulation phase angle when the heaving motion is not considered and the undulation amplitude studied is relatively small, instead, they are significantly affected by the phase angle of the heaving motion. The foil bypassing the vortices undergoes both minimum thrust and input power, whereas the one passing through vortices experiences a larger thrust. The phase angle difference between the heave and the undulation is important. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of the flow past a fixed oblate spheroidal bubble are carried out to determine the range of parameters within which the flow may be unstable, and to gain some insight into the instability mechanism. The bubble aspect ratio $\chi$ (i.e. the ratio of the major axis length over the minor axis length) is varied from 2.0 to 2.5 while the Reynolds number (based on the upstream velocity and equivalent bubble diameter) is varied in the range 102 ≤ Re ≤ 3 × 103. As vorticity generation at the bubble surface is at the root of the instability, theoretical estimates for the maximum of the surface vorticity and the surface vorticity flux are first derived. It is shown that, for large aspect ratios and high Reynolds numbers, the former evolves as $\chi$8/3 while the latter is proportional to $\chi$7/2 Re-1/2. Then it is found numerically that the flow first becomes unstable for $\chi$ = $\chi$c ≈ 2.21. As the surface vorticity becomes independent of Re for large enough Reynolds number, the flow is unstable only within a finite range of Re, this range being an increasing function of $\chi$ - $\chi$c. An empirical criterion based on the maximum of the vorticity generated at the body surface is built to determine whether the flow is stable or not. It is shown that this criterion also predicts the correct threshold for the wake instability past a rigid sphere, suggesting that the nature of the body surface does not really matter in the instability mechanism. Also the first two bifurcations of the flow are similar in nature to those found in flows past rigid axisymmetric bluff bodies, such as a sphere or a disk. Wake dynamics become more complex at higher Reynolds number, until the Re-1/2 -dependency of the surface vorticity flux makes the flow recover its steadiness and eventually its axisymmetry. A qualitative analysis of the azimuthal vorticity field in the base flow at the rear of the bubble is finally carried out to make some progress in the understanding of the primary instability. It is suggested that the instability originates in a thin region of the flow where the vorticity gradients have to turn almost at right angle to satisfy two different constraints, one at the bubble surface, the other within the standing eddy. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {With interest in topics such as climate change, energy security, and alternative energy sources being at an all-time high, the effects of today's decisions now rest on the shoulders of future generations. There are no easy answers to our energy issues, so costs and benefits must be considered when evaluating all energy alternatives; alongside that, prices must be right and need to reflect the full social costs to society of a given source of energy. Energy Economics outlines the fundamental issues and possible solutions to the challenges of energy production and use, and presents a framework for energy decisions based upon sound economic analysis. It considers market forces and policy goals, including economic prosperity, environmental protection, and other considerations that affect societal well-being. This book focuses on both energy choices and the impact of these choices on market performance, environmental conditions, and sustainability. The initial section covers the fundamental economic concepts for analyzing energy markets. Following this, a detailed analysis of established energy sources, specifically fossil fuels and nuclear energy, leads into consideration of energy alternatives such as renewable energy and next-generation alternatives. Electricity production and regulatory trends are covered in depth. The final section considers policy: environmental considerations, sustainability, and energy security. The concluding chapter is a comprehensive vision for our energy future. Drawing on current energy headlines, perspectives familiar from the popular press, and views outside economics, this text sharpens students' ability to understand, evaluate, and critique policy using appropriate economic analysis. The text builds a foundation that culminates in a view of a comprehensive energy policy that improves upon the vacillations of past decades.},

Fluid Mech. 784, 304-341 (2015)] present a force theory for a body in a two-dimensional, viscous, compressible, and steady flow. In this companion paper, we do the same for three-dimensional flows. Using the fundamental solution of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, we improve the force formula for incompressible flows originally derived by Goldstein in 1931 and summarized by Milne-Thomson in 1968, both being far from complete, to its perfect final form, which is further proved to be universally true from subsonic to supersonic flows. We call this result the unified force theorem, which states that the forces are always determined by the vector circulation Pϕ of longitudinal velocity and the scalar inflow Q$\psi$ of transverse velocity. Since this theorem is not directly observable either experimentally or computationally, a testable version is also derived, which, however, holds only in the linear far field. We name this version the testable unified force formula. After that, a general principle to increase the lift-drag ratio is proposed.},

abstract = {Different types of interfacial conditions between a porous medium and a fluid layer are analyzed in detail. Five primary categories of interface conditions were found in the literature for the fluid flow at the interface region. Likewise, four primary categories of interface conditions were found in the literature for the heat transfer at the interface region. These interface conditions can be classified into two main categories, slip and no-slip interface conditions. The effects of the pertinent parameters such as Darcy number, inertia parameter, Reynolds number, porosity and slip coefficients, on different types of interface conditions are analyzed while fluid flow and heat transfer in the neighborhood of an interface region are properly characterized. A systematic analysis of the variances among different boundary conditions establishes the convergence or divergence among competing models. It is shown that in general, the variances have a more pronounced effect on the velocity field and a substantially smaller effect on the temperature field and even a smaller effect on the Nusselt number distributions. For heat transfer interface conditions, all four categories generate results, which are quite close to each other for most practical applications. However, small discrepancies could appear for applications dealing with large values of Reynolds number and/or large values of Darcy number. Finally, a set of correlations is given for interchanging the interface velocity and temperature as well as the average Nusselt number among various models.},

abstract = {The separated flow past a zero-thickness flat plate held normal to a free stream at Re = 250 has been investigated through numerical experiments. The long-time signatures of the drag and lift coefficients clearly capture a low-frequency unsteadiness with a period of approximately 10 times the primary shedding period. The amplitude and frequency of drag and lift variations during the shedding process are strongly modulated by the low frequency. A physical interpretation of the low-frequency behaviour is that the flow gradually varies between two different regimes: a regime H of high mean drag and a regime L of low mean drag. It is observed that in regime H the shear layer rolls up closer to the plate to form coherent spanwise vortices, while in regime L the shear layer extends farther downstream and the rolled-up K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortices are less coherent. In the high-drag regime three-dimensionality is characterized by coherent K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortices and reasonably well-organized streamwise vortices connecting the K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortices. With a non-dimensional spanwise wavelength of about 1.2, the three-dimensionality in this regime is reminiscent of mode-B three-dimensionality. It is observed that the high degree of spanwise coherence that exists in regime H breaks down in regime L. Based on detailed numerical flow visualization we conjecture that the formation of streamwise and spanwise vortices is not in perfect synchronization and that the low-frequency unsteadiness is the result of this imbalance (or phase mismatch).},

The global quantities of the shedding flow appear evident variation for Da varied from 10-5 to 10-4. In particular, Strouhal number displays an obvious jump for Da = 10-4 at Re = 250, due to the variation inflow structure near the cylinder. Larger Darcy number postpones the occurrence of flow fluctuation, and the oscillation flow presents stronger amplitude. However, the flow field and the characteristic values of vortex shedding for Da ≤10-6 are almost not changed. For different porosity, time histories of CD and CL look similar. In conclusion, Darcy number demonstrates more influence on the flow field than porosity does.},

abstract = {The asymptotic theory for the laminar, incompressible, separating and reattaching flow past the bluff body is based on an extension of Kirchhoff's (1869) free-streamline solution. The flow field (only the upper half of which is discussed since we consider a symmetric body and flow) consists of two basic parts. The first is the flow on the body scale l*, which is described to leading order by the Kirchhoff solution with smooth inviscid separation, but with an [formula ommited] modification to explain fully the viscous separation (here Re (≫ 1) is the Reynolds number). The influence of this [formula ommited] modification is determined for the circular cylinder. The second part is the large-scale flow, comprising mainly the eddy and the ultimate wake. The eddy has length scale O(Rel*), width O(Re½l*) and is of elliptical shape to keep the eddy pressure almost uniform. The ultimate wake is determined numerically and fixes the eddy length. The (asymptotically small) back pressure from the eddy acts (on the body scale) both in the free stream and in the eddy, and it has a marked effect at moderate Reynolds numbers; combined with the Kirchhoff solution, it predicts the pressure drag on a circular cylinder accurately, to within 10{\%} when Re = 5 and to within 4{\%} when Re = 50. Other predictions, for the eddy length and width, the front pressure and the eddy pressure, also show encouraging agreement with experiments and Navier-Stokes solutions at moderate Reynolds numbers (of about 30), both for the circular cylinder and the normal flat plate. Finally, an analysis in the appendix indicates that, in wind-tunnel experiments, the tunnel walls (even if widely spaced) can exert considerable influence on the eddy properties, eventually forcing an upper bound on the eddy width as Re increases instead of the O(l* Re½) growth appropriate to the unbounded flow situation. {\textcopyright} 1979, Cambridge University Press.

This work is motivated by a common belief that live and inanimate objects may extract energy from unsteady flows for locomotory advantages. Studies on energy extraction from unsteady flows focus primarily on energy efficiency. Besides efficiency, a fundamental aspect of energy extraction for locomotion purposes is stability of motion. Here, we propose idealized wake models using periodically generated point vortices to emulate shedding of vortices from an un-modeled moving or stationary object. We assess the stability of these point-vortex wakes and find that they are stable for a range of periods, unlike the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n street model which is mainly unstable. We then investigate the dynamics of a rigid body submerged in such wakes. In particular, we calculate periodic trajectories where the rigid body "swims" passively against the flow by extracting energy from the ambient vortices. All the periodic trajectories we find are unstable. The largest instabilities reported are for elliptic bodies where rotational effects play a role in destabilizing their motion. Within the context of this model, we conclude that passive locomotion of rigid bodies in inviscid wakes is unstable. Questions as to whether passive stability can be achieved when accounting for fluid viscosity and body elasticity remain open. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The free fall of heavy bodies in a viscous fluid medium is a problem of interest to many engineering and scientific disciplines, including the study of unpowered flight and seed dispersal. The falling behaviour of coins and thin discs in particular has been categorized into one of four distinct modes; steady, fluttering, chaotic or tumbling, depending on the moment of inertia and Reynolds number. This paper investigates, through a carefully designed experiment, the falling dynamics of thin discs with central holes. The effects of the central hole on the disc's motion is characterized for a range of Reynolds number, moments of inertia and inner to outer diameter ratio. By increasing this ratio, that is, the hole size, the disc is found to transition from tumbling to chaotic then fluttering at values of the moment of inertia not predicted by the falling modes of whole discs. This transition from tumbling to fluttering with increased hole size is viewed as a stabilization process. Flow visualization of the wake behind annular discs shows the presence of a vortex ring at the disc's outer edge, as in the case of whole discs, and an additional counter-rotating vortex ring at the disc's inner edge. The inner vortex ring is responsible for stabilizing the disc's falling motion. These findings have significant implications on the development of design principles for engineered robotic systems in free flight, and may shed light on the stability of gliding animals.},

abstract = {The viscous flow over a thick permeable circular disk in the Reynolds number (Re) range of 10 to 130 and in the Darcy number (Da) range of 10-9 to 1 is examined. Direct numerical simulations are performed on a 2D grid with axisymmetric boundary conditions. Three flow regimes are observed: I, II, and III. In regime I (effectively impervious; Da {\textless} 10-6), the wake is characterized by the presence of a toroidal vortex whose length is approximately equal to that of an impervious disk. In regime II (transition; 10-6 {\textless} Da {\textless} 10-3), the increase in Da causes the vortex to shorten and move downstream and eventually vanishes at a critical Darcy number Dac. Regime III (Da {\textgreater} 10-3) is the highly permeable regime, in which there is no recirculation. In I, good agreement with existing experimental data for impervious disks is found. In III, an analytical expression for the drag force on the disk is derived, showing good agreement with the numerical results. A global upper limit of Dac = Damax above which the disk is unable to maintain a recirculating wake for any Re is identified. Finally, in regime II, it is demonstrated that increasing the permeability can lead to large variations in the length of the recirculating wake but with minimal effect on the drag coefficient even when Da {\textgreater} Damax. This has important implications in our understanding of the locomotive strategies adopted by organisms that use porous bodies for movement.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on the flow past a porous square cylinder, implementing the stress jump treatments for the porous-fluid interface. Design/methodology/approach - The numerical method was developed for flows involving an interface between a homogenous fluid and a porous medium. It is based on the finite volume method with body-fitted and multi-block grids. The Brinkman-Forcheimmer extended model was used to govern the flow in the porous medium region. At its interface, a shear stress jump that includes the inertial effect was imposed, together with a continuity of normal stress. Findings - The present model is validated by comparing with those for the flow around a solid circular cylinder. Results for flow around porous square cylinder are presented with flow configurations for different Darcy number, 10-2 to 10 -5, porosity from 0.4 to 0.8, and Reynolds number 20 to 250. The flow develops from steady to unsteady periodic vortex shedding state. It was found that the stress jump interface condition can cause flow instability. The first coefficient $\beta$ has a more noticeable effect whereas the second coefficient $\beta$1 has very small effect, even for Re=200. The effects of the porosity, Darcy number, and Reynolds number on lift and drag coefficients, and the length of circulation zone or shedding period are studied. Originality/value - The present study implements the numerical method based on finite volume method with a collocated variable arrangement to treat the stress jump condition. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The smallest flying insects commonly possess bristled wings and use drag to provide flight forces. A bristled wing, with a wing area about 10{\%} of that of a flat-plate wing, operating at the relevant Reynolds number of 5-15, produces a drag close to the plate wing. How this is done is not well understood. Here, detailed flows around each of the bristles are investigated numerically using simple model wings, and the following results are shown. (1) The drag production mechanism of the bristled wing is different from that of the plate wing: For the plate wing, the flow is blocked by the wing, giving a small positive pressure on the windward surface, and there exists a pair of weak vortices on the wing back, giving a small negative pressure on the leeward surface; the drag is due to the pressure forces (the frictional stress has almost no contribution). For the bristled wing, each bristle operates in a creeping flow and produces thick and strong shear layers. Strong viscous force generates a very large pressure difference between the windward and leeward surfaces of each bristle and very large frictional stress on the bristle surface, resulting in a large drag on each bristle, and the drag is equally contributed by the pressure and frictional forces. (2) Due to the flow-interference effect, when the bristle number reaches a certain value, a further increase in bristles has little effect on force production but has the disadvantage of increasing wing mass; this means that for a bristled wing of miniature insects, the distribution density of the bristles will not be too large, which agrees with observations.},

abstract = {Unlike the smooth wings of common insects or birds, micro-scale insects such as the fairyfly have a distinctive wing geometry, comprising a frame with several bristles. Motivated by this peculiar wing geometry, we experimentally investigated the flow structure of a translating comb-like wing for a wide range of gap size, angle of attack, and Reynolds number, Re = O(10) - O(103), and the correlation of these parameters with aerodynamic performance. The flow structures of a smooth plate without a gap and a comb-like plate are significantly different at high Reynolds number, while little difference was observed at the low Reynolds number of O(10). At low Reynolds number, shear layers that were generated at the edges of the tooth of the comb-like plate strongly diffuse and eventually block a gap. This gap blockage increases the effective surface area of the plate and alters the formation of leading-edge and trailing-edge vortices. As a result, the comb-like plate generates larger aerodynamic force per unit area than the smooth plate. In addition to a quasi-steady phase after the comb-like plate travels several chords, we also studied a starting phase of the shear layer development when the comb-like plate begins to translate from rest. While a plate with small gap size can generate aerodynamic force at the starting phase as effectively as at the quasi-steady phase, the aerodynamic force drops noticeably for a plate with a large gap because the diffusion of the developing shear layers is not enough to block the gap.},

abstract = {Scaling laws for the overlap region of near-wall turbulent flows are of particular interest to turbulence researchers and engineers. For the mean flow at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, the classical boundary layer theory proposes a logarithmic law for the overlap region. On the other hand, at low Reynolds numbers, refined measurements and direct numerical simulation results indicate that the log law region becomes negligibly small. Instead, power laws have received increasing attention as an alternative formulation for the overlap region at low Reynolds numbers. In the present study, we use open channel flow measurements to assess the ability of the power laws proposed by Barenblatt [J. Fluid Mech. 248, 513 (1993)] and George and Castillo [Appl. Mech. Rev. 50, 689 (1997)] to describe the overlap region in low Reynolds number boundary layers on smooth and rough surfaces. The skin friction laws derived from the power laws are also used to estimate the friction velocity, which values are then compared to measurements obtained by other reliable techniques. The results indicate that at low Reynolds numbers the power law formulations can model a wider extent of the flow than the classical logarithmic profile. Both Barenblatt's and George and Castillo's power laws give an excellent prediction of the friction velocities for flows over a smooth surface, but only the skin friction law proposed by George and Castillo gives good prediction for the rough wall data. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The smallest flying insects commonly possess wings with long bristles. Little quantitative information is available on the morphology of these bristles, and their functional importance remains a mystery. In this study, we (1) collected morphological data on the bristles of 23 species of Mymaridae by analyzing high-resolution photographs and (2) used the immersed boundary method to determine via numerical simulation whether bristled wings reduced the force required to fling the wings apart while still maintaining lift. The effects of Reynolds number, angle of attack, bristle spacing and wing-wing interactions were investigated. In the morphological study, we found that as the body length of Mymaridae decreases, the diameter and gap between bristles decreases and the percentage of the wing area covered by bristles increases. In the numerical study, we found that a bristled wing experiences less force than a solid wing. The decrease in force with increasing gap to diameter ratio is greater at higher angles of attack than at lower angles of attack, suggesting that bristled wings may act more like solid wings at lower angles of attack than they do at higher angles of attack. In wing-wing interactions, bristled wings significantly decrease the drag required to fling two wings apart compared with solid wings, especially at lower Reynolds numbers. These results support the idea that bristles may offer an aerodynamic benefit during clap and fling in tiny insects.},

abstract = {The accuracy of numerical simulation algorithms is one of main concerns in modern Computational Fluid Dynamics. Development of new and more accurate mathe- matical models requires an insight into the problem of numerical errors. In order to construct an estimate of the solution error in Finite Volume calculations, it is first necessary to examine its sources. Discretisation errors can be divided into two groups: errors caused by the discretisation of the solution domain and equation discretisation errors. The first group includes insufficient mesh reso- lution, mesh skewness and non-orthogonality. In the case of the second order Finite Volume method, equation discretisation errors are represented through numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion coefficients from the discretisation of the convection term and the temporal derivative are derived. In an attempt to reduce numeri- cal diffusion from the convection term, a new stabilised and bounded second-order differencing scheme is proposed. Three new methods of error estimation are presented. The Direct Taylor Series Error estimate is based on the Taylor series truncation error analysis. It is set up to enable single-mesh single-run error estimation. The Moment Error estimate derives the solution error from the cell imbalance in higher moments of the solution. A suitable normalisation is used to estimate the error magnitude. The Residual Error estimate is based on the local inconsistency between face interpolation and volume integration. Extensions of the method to transient flows and the Local Residual Problem error estimate are also given. Finally, an automatic error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is set up in order to automatically produce a solution of pre-determined accuracy. It uses mesh refinement and unrefinement to control the local error magnitude. The method is tested on several characteristic flow situations, ranging from incompressible to supersonic flows, for both steady-state and transient problems.},

The motion of the discs is investigated by a direct numerical simulation of the solid-fluid interaction. The discs are assumed to be homogeneous and infinitely thin. The problem is shown to depend on two independent parameters, the Galileo number expressing the ratio between effects of gravity and viscosity and the non-dimensionalized mass characterizing the inertia of the disc. The obtained results are in agreement with known experimental and numerical data and provide both detailed and comprehensive picture of the transition scenario in the two-parameter plane defined by the Galileo number and the non-dimensionalized mass. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

The fluid mechanics formulation and its suitability and accuracy for rotating turbulent flows; 3. The coupling of air flow and a rotating rigid body. In Part 2, we focus on the structural discretization for wind turbine blades and the details of the fluid–structure interaction computational procedures. The methods developed are applied to the simulation of the NREL 5MW offshore baseline wind turbine rotor. The simulations are performed at realistic wind velocity and rotor speed conditions and at full spatial scale. Validation against published data is presented and possibilities of the newly developed computational framework are illustrated on several examples.},

abstract = {The behaviour of a passive system of two-dimensional linked rigid bodies in the wake of a circular cylinder at Re = 100 is studied computationally. The three rigid bodies are connected by two frictionless hinges, and the system ('fish') is initially aligned with a streamwise axis three diameters behind the cylinder. Once flow symmetry is broken, the wake rolls up into a K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street in which the fish is stably trapped, and the passing large-scale vortices induce an undulatory shape change in the articulated system. It is found that, for certain fish lengths relative to cylinder diameter, the fish is propelled upstream toward the cylinder. Furthermore, the fish is propelled equally effectively when the hinges are locked, confirming that induced body undulation is not necessary for achieving a net thrust. An analysis of the forces on constituent bodies shows that leading-edge suction and negative skin friction on the forward portion of the fish are in competition with positive skin friction on the aft portion; propulsion is achieved when the forebody contributions dominate those on the aftbody. It is shown that the so-called 'suction zone' behind the cylinder that enables this passive propulsion is double the length of that without a fish present. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {In physical systems, a reduction in dimensionality often leads to exciting new phenomena. Here we discuss the novel effects arising from the consideration of fluid turbulence confined to two spatial dimensions. The additional conservation constraint on squared vorticity relative to three-dimensional (3D) turbulence leads to the dual-cascade scenario of Kraichnan and Batchelor with an inverse energy cascade to larger scales and a direct enstrophy cascade to smaller scales. Specific theoretical predictions of spectra, structure functions, probability distributions, and mechanisms are presented, and major experimental and numerical comparisons are reviewed. The introduction of 3D perturbations does not destroy the main features of the cascade picture, implying that 2D turbulence phenomenology establishes the general picture of turbulent fluid flows when one spatial direction is heavily constrained by geometry or by applied body forces. Such flows are common in geophysical and planetary contexts, are beautiful to observe, and reflect the impact of dimensionality on fluid turbulence.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Despite the rapid development of mechanistic dispersal models, only a few studies have focused on comparing the performance of the models.

The velocity and temperature deviations are obtained based on flow over a dilute array of spheres, incorporated with a scale analysis. A multiplying constant (i.e. the thermal dispersivity tensor) is introduced to account for the interaction of spheres. Separate considerations are given to the creeping flow at low Reynolds numbers, as well as boundary layer flow and wakes at high Reynolds numbers. It is found that the velocity and porosity dependencies in the thermal dispersion conductivity tensor are different for high Reynolds number and low Reynolds number porous media flows. The value of the transverse thermal dispersivity for a nearly parallel flow at high Reynolds numbers is determined by comparing the predicted heat transfer characteristics with existing experimental results for forced convection of water and air through heated packed channels and cylindrical packed tubes. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Fish may take advantage of environmental vortices to save the cost of locomotion. The complex hydrodynamics shed from multiple physical objects may significantly affect fish refuging (holding stationary). Taking a model of a self-propelled flapping plate, we numerically studied the locomotion of the plate in wakes of two tandem cylinders. In most simulations, the plate heaves at its initial position G0 before the flow comes (releasing Style I). In the typical wake patterns, the plate may hold stationary, drift upstream, or drift downstream. The phase diagrams of these modes in the G0-A plane for the vortex shedding patterns were obtained, where A is the flapping amplitude. It is observed that the plate is able to hold stationary at multiple equilibrium locations after it is released. Meanwhile, the minimum amplitude and the input power required for the plate seem inversely proportional to the shedding vortex strength. The effect of releasing style was also investigated. If the plate keeps stationary and does not flap until the vortex shedding is fully developed (releasing Style II), then the plate is able to hold stationary at some equilibrium locations but the flapping plate has a very minor effect on the shedding vortices. However, in Style I, the released plate is able to achieve more equilibrium locations through adjusting the phase of vortex shedding. The effort of the preflapping in Style I is not in vain, because although it consumes more energy, it becomes easier to hold stationary later. The relevant mechanism is explored.},

abstract = {Most computational fluid dynamics simulations are, at present, performed in a body-fixed frame, for aeronautical purposes. With the advent of sharp manoeuvre, which may lead to transient effects originating in the acceleration of the centre of mass, there is a need to have a consistent formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations in an arbitrarily moving frame. These expressions should be in a form that allows terms to be transformed between non-inertial and inertial frames and includes gravity, viscous terms, and linear and angular acceleration. Since no effects of body acceleration appear in the inertial frame Navier–Stokes equations themselves, but only in their boundary conditions, it is useful to investigate acceleration source terms in the non-inertial frame. In this paper, a derivation of the energy equation is provided in addition to the continuity and momentum equations previously published. Relevant dimensionless constants are derived which can be used to obtain an indication of the relative significance of acceleration effects. The necessity for using computational fluid dynamics to capture nonlinear effects remains, and various implementation schemes for accelerating bodies are discussed. This theoretical treatment is intended to provide a foundation for interpretation of aerodynamic effects observed in manoeuvre, particularly for accelerating missiles.},

For the clear fluid zone, the regular Navier-Stokes equation is used; and the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model is used for simulating flow in the porous zone. The governing equations, together with the relevant boundary conditions, are solved numerically using the finite-volume method (FVM). In this study, the ranges of Reynolds and Darcy numbers are 1-45 and 10-6-10 -2, respectively. The effects of the Darcy and Reynolds numbers on several hydrodynamics parameters such as pressure coefficient, wake structure, and streamlines are explored. Finally, these parameters are compared with the solid and porous diamond-square cylinders. The numerical results indicate that the wake length and pressure coefficient decrease when Darcy number increases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Three hydrodynamic interface conditions considered in this study were the slip condition, the stress continuity condition and the stress jump condition. These interface conditions were applied at various assumed locations and the performances of these conditions were evaluated by comparing with the results obtained from the numerical simulations. The numerical simulations were carried out by varying the geometry, the arrangement of the cylinders, and the porosity of the porous medium. The velocity profile in the clear fluid region is accurately modeled by all the three interface conditions. The velocity profile in the transition layer obtained using the stress jump condition at the interface is observed to be closer to the present numerical simulation results compared to the velocity profiles developed using the other two interface conditions for every configuration of the porous medium at every interface location.},

abstract = {We extend the work of Sutherland and Peltier (Phys. Fluids 6 (1994) 1267) and investigate numerically the three-dimensional (3D) secondary stability of a wake forming behind a thin flat plate. The primary flow is a K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street numerically computed from the two-dimensional (2D) even instability of a parallel wake based on the Bickley velocity profile. Considering the symmetries of the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n Street, the 3D modes are classified into two families, whether symmetric or antisymmetric. For each family, we determine the leading eigenmodes using a Krylov method. The growth rate curves show that both the most unstable symmetric and antisymmetric modes are stationary and present a maximum of amplification for a wavelength of the order of the primary vortex spacing. The maximum growth rate, corresponding wavelength and cutoff wavelength are well predicted by the elliptic instability of the vortex core. The eigenmode structure of the most unstable wavenumber is centered in the core and is typical of the elliptic instability. The hyperbolic instability of the braid region gives a growth rate five times larger and a cutoff two times higher than the ones computed. As recently discussed for mixing layers by Caulfield and Kerswell (Phys. Fluids 12 (5) (2000) 1032), this is not surprising since the hyperbolic instability applies for an unbounded hyperbolic flow. When the region of hyperbolic flow is bounded, intense transient growth is generated, but when time goes to infinity, the instability becomes small or even dies out. Finally, good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found with the experiments previously done by Julien, Lasheras and Chomaz (J. Fluid Mech. 479 (2003) 155) on the secondary instability in the wake of a flat plate for the symmetry selection, the most amplified wavenumber and growth rate. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier SAS.

More recent theoretical studies have emphasized the role played by deterministic chaos, although many experimental studies were performed before the development of such ideas. Here we report experimental observations of the dynamics of disks falling in water/glycerol mixtures. We find four distinct types of motion, which are mapped out in a 'phase diagram'. The apparently complex behaviour can be reduced to a series of one-dimensional maps, which display a discontinuity at the crossover from periodic to chaotic motion. This discontinuity leads to an unusual intermittency transition, not previously observed experimentally, between the two behaviours.},

abstract = {Turbulent flows are characterized by the non-linear cascades of energy and other inviscid invariants across a huge range of scales, from where they are injected to where they are dissipated. Recently, new experimental, numerical and theoretical works have revealed that many turbulent configurations deviate from the ideal three and two dimensional homogeneous and isotropic cases characterized by the presence of a strictly direct and inverse energy cascade, respectively. New phenomena appear that alter the global and local transfer properties. In this review, we provide a critical summary of historical and recent works from a unified point of view and we present a classification of all known transfer mechanisms. Beside the classical cases of direct and inverse energy cascades, the different scenarios include: split cascades for which an invariant flows both to small and large scales simultaneously, multiple/dual cascades of different quantities, bi-directional cascades where direct and inverse transfers of the same invariant coexist in the same scale-range and finally equilibrium states where no cascades are present, including the case when a large scale condensate is formed. We classify all possible transitions from one scenario to another as the control parameters are changed and we analyse when and why different configurations are observed. Our discussion is based on a set of paradigmatic applications: helical turbulence, rotating and/or stratified flows, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence, and passive/active scalars where the transfer properties are altered as one changes the embedding dimensions, the thickness of the domain or other relevant control parameters, as, e.g., the Reynolds, Rossby, Froude, P{\'{e}}clet, or Alfv{\'{e}}n numbers. We briefly discuss the presence of anomalous scaling laws in 3D hydrodynamics and in other configurations, in connection with the intermittent nature of the energy dissipation in configuration space. A quick overview is also provided concerning the importance of cascades in other applications such as bounded flows, quantum fluids, relativistic and compressible turbulence, and active matter, together with a discussion of the implications for turbulent modelling. Finally, we present a series of open problems and challenges that future work needs to address.},

A homogenized model is used to treat the flow field in the porous region, and different interface conditions, needed to match solutions at the boundary between the pure fluid and the porous regions, are evaluated. Two problems in different flow regimes (laminar and turbulent) are considered to validate the system, which includes inertia in the leading-order equations for the permeability tensor through a Oseen approximation. The components of the permeability, which characterize microscopically the porous medium and determine the flow field at the macroscopic scale, are reasonably well estimated by the theory, both in the laminar and the turbulent case. This is demonstrated by comparing the model's results to both experimental measurements and direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations which resolve the flow also through the pores of the medium.},

abstract = {Motivated by the explosive launch of Sphagnum spores, this experimental study investigates how the vortices generated from two different sources, a piston-cylinder apparatus and a translating bluff body, interact with each other. While there have been numerous studies on the formation of a single vortex ring or multiple vortex rings, little is known about the effect of a translating bluff body on the formation of the coupled vortices. By varying the stroke ratio of the piston and the velocity ratio of the body to the piston, three distinct modes are identified for the mutual interaction between the starting jet from the piston and the wake from the cap: spill mode, attached mode and detached mode. The transitions between the vortex modes are predicted with simple analytical models. For the attached mode that appears at a velocity ratio intermediate between those of the spill mode and the detached mode, the merged flow structure becomes similar to a single vortex ring in the absence of the bluff body. By virtue of stable propagation following the cap, the vortex of the attached mode is capable of transporting a significant fluid volume initially inside the cylinder over a long distance, which shows its effectiveness in transport using a ballistic mechanism.},

Then we show how these equations can be employed in conjunction with the Navier-Stokes equations to solve numerically the coupled problem in which the presence of the body modifies the surrounding flow which itself determines the trajectory of the body. Numerical tests of this coupling are presented. We finally apply the coupled set of equations to analyze the path instability of ellipsoidal bubbles rising at high Reynolds number. We show that numerical results recover the main experimental trends, an agreement suggesting that path instability is primarily driven by the instability of the wake which is itself crucially dependent on the curvature of the bubble surface. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Long-distance dispersal of seeds (LDD) surely affects most ecological and evolutionary processes related to plant species. Hence, numerous attempts to quantify LDD have been made and, especially for wind dispersal, several simulation models have been developed. However, the mechanisms promoting LDD by wind still remain ambiguous and the effects of different weather conditions on LDD, although recognized as important, have only rarely been investigated. Here we examine the influence of wind speed and updrafts on dispersal of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale agg.), a typical wind-dispersed herb of open habitats. We used PAPPUS, a weather-sensitive mechanistic simulation model of wind dispersal, which considers frequency distribution of weather conditions during the period the simulation refers to. A simulation for the 4-month shedding period of dandelion shows that high wind speed does not promote LDD. In contrast, vertical turbulence, especially convective updrafts, are of overwhelming importance. Mainly caused by updrafts, in the simulations more than 0.05{\%} of dandelion seeds were dispersed beyond 100 m, a distance commonly used to define LDD. We conclude that long-distance dispersal of seeds of herbaceous species with falling velocities {\textless}0.5-1.0 ms-1 is mainly caused by convective updrafts.},

abstract = {Using DNS, we investigate the dynamics in the wake of a circular disk of aspect ratio $\chi$ = d/w = 3 (where d is the diameter and w the thickness) embedded in a uniform flow of magnitude U 0 perpendicular to its symmetry axis. As the Reynolds number Re = U 0 d/$\nu$ is increased, the flow is shown to experience an original series of bifurcations leading to chaos. The range Re in [150, 218] is analysed in detail. In this range, five different non-axisymmetric regimes are successively encountered, including states similar to those previously identified in the flow past a sphere or an infinitely thin disk, as well as a new regime characterised by the presence of two distinct frequencies. A theoretical model based on the theory of mode interaction with symmetries, previously introduced to explain the bifurcations in the flow past a sphere or an infinitely thin disk (Fabre et al. in Phys Fluids 20:051702, 2008), is shown to explain correctly all these results. Higher values of the Reynolds number, up to 270, are also considered.

The usage of this tool for averaging continuity and momentum equations yields a Darcy's law with three contributions: (i) similar to the classical Darcy's law, a term depending on macroscopic pressure gradients and gravitational forces; (ii) a fractional convective term induced by spatial porosity gradients; and (iii) a fractional Brinkman-type correction. In the three cases, the corresponding permeability tensors should be computed from a fractional boundary-value problem within a representative cell.

The modified slip condition involving the thickness of the porous layer is derived using the variation of velocity in the porous medium with the proper matching conditions based on the physical considerations. It is shown that when the thickness of the porous layer tends to infinity our modified slip condition tends to the slip condition postulated by Beavers and Joseph 13.

The velocity profiles in the porous layer are shown to exhibit the boundary-layer type very near the porous surface; they increase with increase in depth of the porous medium and decrease with increases in $\Lambda$.

abstract = {The ready availability of full-field velocity measurements in present-day experiments has kindled interest in using such data for force estimation, especially in situations where direct measurements are difficult. Among the methods proposed, a formulation based on impulse is attractive, for both practical and physical reasons. However, evaluation of the impulse requires a complete description of the vorticity field, and this is particularly hard to achieve in the important region close to a body surface. This paper presents a solution to the problem. The incomplete experimental-vorticity field is augmented by a vortex sheet on the body, with strength determined by the no-slip boundary condition. The impulse is then found from the sum of vortex-sheet and experimental contributions. Components of physical interest can straightforwardly be recognised; for example, the classical 'added mass' associated with fluid inertia is represented by an explicit term in the formulation for the vortex sheet. The method is implemented in the context of two-dimensional flat-plate flow, and tested on velocity-field data from a translating wing experiment. The results show that the vortex-sheet contribution is significant for the test data set. Furthermore, when it is included, good agreement with force-balance measurements is found. It is thus recommended that any impulse-based force calculation should correct for (likely) data incompleteness in this way.},

abstract = {Heavier-than-air flight at any scale is energetically expensive. This is greatly exacerbated at small scales and has so far presented an insurmountable obstacle for untethered flight in insect-sized (mass less than 500 milligrams and wingspan less than 5 centimetres) robots. These vehicles1–4 thus need to fly tethered to an offboard power supply and signal generator owing to the challenges associated with integrating onboard electronics within a limited payload capacity. Here we address these challenges to demonstrate sustained untethered flight of an insect-sized flapping-wing microscale aerial vehicle. The 90-milligram vehicle uses four wings driven by two alumina-reinforced piezoelectric actuators to increase aerodynamic efficiency (by up to 29 per cent relative to similar two-wing vehicles5) and achieve a peak lift-to-weight ratio of 4.1 to 1, demonstrating greater thrust per muscle mass than typical biological counterparts6. The integrated system of the vehicle together with the electronics required for untethered flight (a photovoltaic array and a signal generator) weighs 259 milligrams, with an additional payload capacity allowing for additional onboard devices. Consuming only 110–120 milliwatts of power, the system matches the thrust efficiency of similarly sized insects such as bees7. This insect-scale aerial vehicle is the lightest thus far to achieve sustained untethered flight (as opposed to impulsive jumping8 or liftoff9).},

abstract = {Hydrogen is considered as a low-carbon substitute for natural gas in the otherwise difficult to decarbonise domestic heating sector. This study presents for the first time, a globally applicable source to sink methodology and analysis that matches geological storage capacity with energy demand. As a case study, it is applied to the domestic heating system in the UK, with a focus on maintaining the existing gas distribution network. To balance the significant annual cyclicity in energy demand for heating, hydrogen could be stored in gas fields offshore and transported via offshore pipelines to the existing gas terminals into the gas network. The hydrogen energy storage demand in the UK is estimated to be {\~{}}77.9 terawatt-hour (TWh), which is approximately 25{\%} of the total energy from natural gas used for domestic heating. The total estimated storage capacity of the gas fields included in this study is 2661.9 TWh. The study reveals that only a few offshore gas fields are required to store enough energy as hydrogen to balance the entire seasonal demand for UK domestic heating. It also demonstrates that as so few fields are required, hydrogen storage will not compete for the subsurface space required for other low-carbon subsurface applications, such as carbon storage or compressed air energy storage.},

abstract = {The self-excited instabilities acting on laminar separation bubbles in the absence of external forcing are studied by means of linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulation. Previous studies demonstrated the existence of a three-dimensional modal instability, that becomes active for bubbles with peak reversed flow of approximately of the free-stream velocity, well below the required for the absolute instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. Direct numerical simulations are used to describe the nonlinear evolution of the primary instability, which is found to correspond to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation and results in fully three-dimensional flows with spanwise inhomogeneity of finite amplitude. An extension of the classic weakly non-parallel analysis is then applied to the bifurcated flows, that have a strong dependence on the cross-stream planes and a mild dependence on the streamwise direction. The spanwise distortion of the separated flow induced by the primary instability is found to strongly destabilize the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, leading to their absolute instability and the appearance of a global oscillator-Type instability. This sequence of instabilities triggers the laminar-Turbulent transition without requiring external disturbances or actuation. The characteristic frequency and streamwise and spanwise wavelengths of the self-excited instability are in good agreement with those reported for low-Turbulence wind-Tunnel experiments without explicit forcing. This indicates that the inherent dynamics described by the self-excited instability can also be relevant when external disturbances are present.},

The variation of lift coefficient, drag coefficient, pitching moment, lift versus drag, the gradient of lift, and location of the aerodynamic center with respect to the angle of attack are presented as a function of the porosity. The data, where possible, are compared with the analytical results. The trend of the experimental results behaves in the same manner as the analytical solution. The measured drag coefficients of the airfoil and wing are also presented. The applicability of the standard equation relating the lift coefficient of a non-porous wing with that of a non-porous airfoil to the case of porous wings is verified by applying the equation to porous wings and validating the results using experimental data. Lift slope decreases as the porosity increases. The drag decreases at a low value of porosity and then increases as porosity increases. The standard equation for obtaining the lift coefficient of a wing from the lift coefficient of an airfoil is applicable and valid for porous wings and airfoils.},

abstract = {We investigate the hovering dynamics of rigid bodies with up-down asymmetry placed in oscillating background flows. Recent experiments on inanimate pyramid-shaped objects in oscillating flows with zero mean component demonstrate that the resulting aerodynamic forces are sufficient to keep the object aloft. The mechanisms responsible for this lift production are fundamentally unsteady and depend on the shed vorticity. Here, we consider a model system of a two-dimensional flyer and compute the unsteady, two-way coupling between the flyer and the surrounding fluid in the context of the vortex sheet model. We examine in detail the flow properties (frequency and speed) required for hovering and their dependence on the flyer's characteristics (mass and geometry). We find that, at low oscillation frequencies, a flyer of a fixed mass and shape requires a constant amount of flow acceleration to hover, irrespective of the frequency and speed of the oscillating flow. Meanwhile, at high oscillation frequencies, the flow speed required to hover is constant. In either case, the aerodynamic requirements to hover (flow acceleration or flow speed) are an intrinsic property of the flyer itself. This physical insight could potentially have significant implications on the design of unmanned air vehicles as well as on understanding active hovering of live organisms that can manipulate their flapping motion to favour a larger oscillation amplitude or frequency.},

abstract = {The flow over a flat plate at a Reynolds number of 750 is numerically investigated via fine large-eddy simulation (LES), first at normal ( 90° ) and then at oblique ( 45° ) incidence flow direction with a uniform steady inlet. The results are in complete agreement with the direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experimental data, thereby serving as a validation for the present simulations. For the normal ( 90° ) uniform inflow case, coherent vortices are alternately shed from both leading edges of the plate, whereas for the oblique ( 45° ) uniform inflow case the vortices shed from the two sides of the plate interact strongly resulting in a quasi-periodic force response. The normal flat plate is then analysed with an incident gust signal with varying amplitude and time period. For these incident coherent gust cases, a reference test case with variable coherent inlet is first studied and the results are compared to a steady inlet simulation, with a detailed analysis of the flow behaviour and the wake response under the incident gust. Finally, the flat plate response to 16 different gust profiles is studied. A transient drag reconstruction for these incident coherent gust cases is then presented based on a frequency-dependent transfer function and phase spectrum analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

@article{Thompson2006,
abstract = {This article presents a short review of the three-dimensional transition of wakes from two-dimensional bodies, such as cylinders of various cross-sectional shape, and axisymmetric tori or rings. The nature and sequence of instabilities are compared and contrasted, especially with reference to the base case of the circular cylinder wake. The latter has been the subject of intense interest and scrutiny for well over a century, and has implicitly assumed the role of providing the generic transition scenario for turbulent wake flow. For elongated cylinders with streamlined leading edges, the analogues of the instability modes for a circular cylinder become unstable in the reverse order, which may have implications for the route to wake turbulence for such bodies. As well, the analogue of mode B has a significantly increased relative spanwise wavelength and appears to have a different near-wake structure. At the other extreme, for a normal flat plate, the wake first becomes unstable to a nonperiodic mode that appears distinct from either of the dominant circular cylinder wake modes. For tori, which have a local geometry approaching a two-dimensional circular cylinder for high aspect ratios (ARs), the sequence of transitions with increasing Reynolds number is a strong function of AR. For intermediate ARs, the first occurring wake instability mode is a subharmonic mode. Possible underlying physical mechanisms leading to some of these instabilities are also examined. In particular, support is provided for the role of idealized physical instability mechanisms in controlling wavelength selection and amplification for the dominant wake instability modes. The results presented in this article focus on relevant research undertaken by the Monash group but draws in results from many other international groups. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Various incidence angles of the disk with respect to the inflow are considered from 0° to 60°, where 0° refers to the condition in which the flow is perpendicular to the disk. The aspect ratio (diameter/thickness) of the disk is considered to be 50. The Reynolds number based on the inflow velocity and the diameter of the disk is up to 500. The drag and lift coefficients, pressure coefficients, and three-dimensional vortical structures are analyzed using time-dependent and time-averaged techniques. Detailed comparisons between the results of the disk at different incidence angles are presented. The flow pattern gradually changes from chaotic to a periodic state as the incidence angle increases from 0° to 60°. At incidence angles of 45° and 50°, an evident low-frequency modulation exists whose period is approximately ten times greater than the primary vortex shedding period. For the inclined disks, the wake flow is tilted to the trailing edge side of the disk rather than parallel to the streamwise direction. The distance between two successive vortical rings is observed to decrease as the incidence angle increases. The streamwise length of the mean recirculation bubble decreases as the incidence angle increases.},

abstract = {In many industrial processes or natural phenomena, coupled heat and mass transfer and fluid flow take place in configurations combining a clear fluid and a porous medium. Since the pioneering work by Beavers and Joseph (1967), the modeling of such systems has been a controversial issue, essentially due to the description of the interface between the fluid and the porous domains. The validity of the so-called one-domain approach-more intuitive and numerically simpler to implement-compared to a two-domain description where the interface is explicitly accounted for, is now clearly assessed. This paper reports recent developments and the current state of the art on this topic, concerning the numerical simulation of such flows as well as the stability studies. The continuity of the conservation equations between a fluid and a porous medium are examined and the conditions for a correct handling of the discontinuity of the macroscopic properties are analyzed. A particular class of problems dealing with thermal and double diffusive natural convection mechanisms in partially porous enclosures is presented, and it is shown that this configuration exhibits specific features in terms of the heat and mass transfer characteristics, depending on the properties of the porous domain. Concerning the stability analysis in a horizontal layer where a fluid layer lies on top of a porous medium, it is shown that the onset of convection is strongly influenced by the presence of the porous medium. The case of double diffusive convection is presented in detail. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract = {Locomotion and feeding in marine animals are intimately linked to the flow dynamics created by specialized body parts. This interaction is of particular importance during ontogeny, when changes in behaviour and scale challenge the organism with shifts in fluid regimes and altered functionality. Previous studies have indicated that Scyphozoan jellyfish ontogeny accommodates the changes in fluid dynamics associated with increasing body dimensions and velocities during development. However, in addition to scale and behaviour that-to a certain degree-underlie the control of the animal, flow dynamics are also dependent on external factors such as temperature. Here, we show phenotypic plasticity in juvenile Aurelia aurita medusae, where morphogenesis is adapted to altered fluid regimes imposed by changes in ambient temperature. In particular, differential proportional growth was found to compensate for temperaturedependent changes in viscous effects, enabling the animal to use adhering water boundary layers as 'paddles'-and thus economize tissue-at low temperatures, while switching to tissue-dominated propulsion at higher temperatures where the boundary layer thickness is insufficient to serve for paddling. This effect was predicted by a model of animal-fluid interaction and confirmed empirically by flowfield visualization and assays of propulsion efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The role of free-stream turbulence (FST) in the hydrodynamic instability mechanisms and transition to turbulence in laminar separation bubbles (LSBs) was investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS). Towards this end, a set of highly resolved DNS have been carried out, where isotropic FST fluctuations with intensities from 0.1{\%} to 3{\%} are introduced to investigate the relevant physical mechanisms governing the interaction of separation and transition in LSBs. For disturbance-free simulations, i.e. without FST, laminar-turbulent transition involves a Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of the separated shear layer. For LSBs subjected to FST, vortical FST fluctuations penetrate the approaching attached laminar boundary layer upstream of the separation location and induce slowly growing low-frequency disturbances, so-called Klebanoff (K) modes, which cause a spanwise modulation with a distinct spanwise wavelength. Simultaneously, the FST enhances the initial levels of instability waves with frequencies in the frequency range of the KH instability, but at much smaller amplitude levels compared to the K-modes. Results from the calculations based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations and comparison with DNS results reveal that the K-mode exhibits exponential growth in the separated shear layer until it reaches a peak amplitude. At the same time, two-dimensional (2D) disturbance waves are also exponentially amplified, in fact at larger growth rate compared to the K-mode, due to the primary (convective) shear-layer instability mechanism until they saturate downstream of the peak amplitude associated with the K-mode. Therefore, based on detailed spectral analysis and modal decompositions for the separation bubbles investigated, the transition process is the result of two different mechanisms: (i) strong amplification of high-frequency (order of the shedding frequency), essentially 2D or weakly oblique fluctuating disturbances and (ii) low-frequency, three-dimensional K-modes caused by FST. Depending on the intensity of the FST, one of these mechanisms would dominate the transition process, or both mechanisms act together and contribute simultaneously. The net effect of these two events is an acceleration of transition for an increased level of FST intensity, which in turn leads to a reduction of the extent of the separation bubble in streamwise and wall-normal directions. The 'roll-up' into spanwise large-scale vortical structures resulting from the shear-layer instability, and the eventual breakdown of these structures, strongly contribute to the reattachment process. The spanwise coherence of these 'rollers' deteriorates due to the presence of large-amplitude K-modes, thus effectively weakening their strength for high levels of FST intensities (Tu {\textgreater} 1{\%}).},

abstract = {The study and control of flow instabilities is a key problem in aerodynamics. Aircrafts are designed not only to generate the lift force needed to balance their weight but, more importantly, to be stable and reasonably steady when in cruise conditions. Similar flow stability properties are naturally achieved by biological flying objects such as the dandelion seeds that are transported by the wind owing to a disklike structure called a pappus. The pappus creates a parachute flow configuration and is a remarkable prototype of how the wake, which would be unsteady if the pappus was completely impermeable, can be stabilized by changing the body structure so as to allow the flow to pass through. We approach the problem using the approximation of an anisotropic and nonhomogeneous rigid porous disk, combined with the linear stability analysis technique. The results show the presence of a mean porosity threshold beyond which the flow is always characterized by a separated, steady, and axisymmetric recirculating vortex ring. We compare our results with those of real dandelion pappi. The threshold is very close to the experimentally observed values of porosity, explaining why the morphology of the pappus promotes a steady wake regime.},

abstract = {We consider the life cycle of an axisymmetric laminar thermal starting from the initial condition of a Gaussian buoyant blob. We find that, as time progresses, the thermal transitions through a number of distinct stages, undergoing several morphological changes before ending up as a vortex ring. Whilst each stage is interesting in its own right, one objective of this study is to set out a consistent mathematical framework under which the entire life cycle can be studied. This allows examination of the transition between the different stages, as well as shedding light on some unsolved questions from previous works. We find that the early stages of formation are key in determining the properties of the final buoyant vortex ring and that, since they occur on a time scale where viscosity has little effect, the final properties of the ring display an independence above a critical Reynolds number. We also find that rings consistently contain the same proportion of the initial heat and have a consistent vorticity flux. By considering the effect of Prandtl number, we show that thermal diffusion can have a significant impact on development, smoothing out the temperature field and inhibiting the generation of vorticity. Finally, by considering the wake left behind as well as the vortex ring that is generated, we observe that the wake can itself roll up to form a second mushroom cap and subsequently a secondary vortex ring that follows the first.},

abstract = {We numerically investigate the passive flight of a flexible -flyer in a vertically oscillating airflow with zero mean stream. The flexibility of the flyer is introduced by a torsion spring installed at the hinged joint. We study the effects of spring stiffness, density, resting angle and actuation efforts on the hovering performance. The results suggest that the occurrence of resonance in flexible flyers can result in significantly different performances in flexible and rigid flyers. It is found that flexibility can have two opposing effects, reducing or increasing the actuation efforts for hovering, depending on the range of driving frequency. This result is explained by the modulation of relative motion between the flyer and the imposed background flow due to the involvement of passive angular oscillation. The angular oscillation patterns, the wake symmetry properties and the postural stability behaviours under different driving conditions are also explored. Based on the findings of the present study, the ideal parameter values for stable hovering are suggested. The results of this study offer novel insight into the mechanism by which the flexibility of the flyer affects the passive hovering performance.},

abstract = {Hairy structures in nature function to sense smells and capture nutrients from surrounding fluid. Motivated by the complicated fluid transport processes observed in biological hairy structures, we numerically investigate the dynamics of fluid particles around multiple solid objects moving in a quiescent fluid, using simple two-dimensional cylinder models in the low-Reynolds-number regime (Re = 1–100). The behavior of fluid particles entrained by a moving cylinder array is analyzed by tracking particle trajectories and computing the drift volume, which indicates the amount of fluid particles transported by the moving cylinders. Hydrodynamic blockage of gaps within the cylinder array, which arises from the overlap of shear layers due to viscous diffusion, is critical in determining the overall fluid particle dynamics. As the number of cylinders increases, the deformation of the material line composed of fluid particles and the magnitude of the resultant drift volume show consistent patterns, despite undergoing drastic changes, and they converge to a specific configuration and magnitude, respectively. This study shows that visualization and quantification of collective fluid transport by multiple solid bodies are important to evaluate the efficiency of fluid transport for a collection of multiple bodies and to find its optimal configuration.},

abstract = {The flow through and around a finite row of parallel slender bodies in close proximity moving in a viscous incompressible fluid is studied. The motion occurs under creeping flow (Re ≪ 1) conditions. This row is a model of a comb-wing configuration found in insects of the Thrips family and being developed for use for flying vehicles of mm size, operating in the creeping flow regime. We show here that such wings utilize viscous effects to carry along enough fluid to approximate continuous surfaces. The comb is described as a row of rod-like ellipsoids of slenderness ratio smaller than 0.01 at distances apart of order 10 times the minor axis and the flow field is computed by distributing singularities along the major axes of the ellipsoids. Results for the drag on the individual rods, as well as for the full row are presented. It is shown that above a certain number of rods, dependent on the geometric parameters of the comb, the row acts very much like a continuous surface, with over 95{\%} of the flow moving around, and not through the comb. This allows a potential saving of tens of percents in wing weight. Parametric results for number of rods, rod density (ratio of inter-rod distance to rod length) and slenderness ratio are presented demonstrating the dependence of the flow field on the configuration. It is found that 50-80 rods are required to approach the asymptotic limit of large number of rods, for various combinations of rod parameters with inter-rod distances of order of the cross-section diameter. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Computation of viscous flow over a circular disk of aspect ratio 10 (thickness/diameter) in the Reynolds number (Re) range of 10 to 300 was performed. The following flow regimes were observed: (I) steady axisymmetric flow when Re {\textless} 135, with the presence of a toroidal vortex behind the disk; (II) regular bifurcation with loss of azimuthal symmetry but with planar symmetry and a double-threaded wake, for 135 ≤ Re {\textless} 155; (III) three-dimensional flow with periodic shedding of double-sided hairpin-shaped vortex structures and periodic motion of the separation region for 155 ≤ Re {\textless} 172; (IV) regular shedding of double-sided hairpin-shaped vortex structures with planar and spatio-temporal symmetry for 172 ≤ Re {\textless} 280; (V) periodic three-dimensional flow with irregular rotation of the separation region when Re = 280-300. This transition process for the disk differs from that for the sphere as we observe a loss of the symmetry plane in Regime III due to a twisting motion of the axial vorticity strands in the wake of the disk. The periodic flow was characterized by double-sided hairpin structures, unlike the one-sided vortex loops observed for the sphere. This resulted in the drag coefficient oscillating at twice the frequency of the axial velocity. In Regime IV, the vortex loops were shed from diametrically opposite locations and with equal strength, resulting in the lift coefficient oscillating symmetrically about a zero mean. These results imply the presence of spatio-temporal symmetry. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

These two equations have numerous applications in the analysis of transport in porous media, and they have been chosen for this study in order to illustrate the role of the averaging procedure and the closure problem in the development of volume averaged transport equations. In our analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations we find that the no-slip condition does not play an important role in the averaging procedure, but that it dominates the structure of the closure problem. On the other hand, our study of the convective-diffusion equation illustrates that the adsorption boundary condition makes an important contribution to the volume averaged transport equation, but contributes very little to the closure problem. We conclude that one must pay careful attention to the averaging procedure, the closure problem, and the boundary conditions in the development of multiphase transport equations.},

abstract = {A micro-scale flying insect has a unique wing configuration consisting of a central frame and several bristles. For the low-Reynolds-number regime in which the insect lives, the bristled wing utilizes a virtual fluid barrier inside gaps produced by strong viscous diffusion of shear layers to overcome its morphological limitations. Considering the unsteady flapping motion of such a wing, the aerodynamic characteristics of gap flow formation are investigated numerically using a two-dimensional bristled wing model for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Inside a gap between bristles, the development of a stopping vortex during the deceleration phase and its effect on the extinction of an existing vortex generated at the same edge are dependent on the Reynolds number, which leads to a significant change in vorticity distribution at stroke reversal even with just a small change in the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number decreases, the gap flow responds more rapidly to wing motion, and its pattern does not deviate significantly from the kinematics of the wing. A noticeable difference is also observed in the behavior of the aerodynamic force acting on each bristle at low and high Reynolds numbers. With regard to aerodynamic force generation by the bristles, each bristle behaves independently and produces similar force because of strong gap flows relative to the wing at high Reynolds numbers. Meanwhile, at low Reynolds numbers, each bristle experiences a different force depending on its relative position, which indicates the existence of collective interaction of bristles through a virtual fluid barrier.},

abstract = {Planar flow in the interfacial region of an open porous medium is investigated by finding solutions for Stokes flow in a channel partially filled with an array of circular cylinders beside one wall. The cylinders are in a square array oriented across the flow and are widely spaced, so that the solid volume fraction $\Phi$ is 0.1 or less. For this spacing, singularity methods are appropriate and so they are used to find solutions for both planar Couette flow and Poiseuille flow in the open portion of the channel. The solutions, accurate to O($\Phi$), are used to calculate the apparent slip velocity at the interface, Us, and results obtained for Us are presented in terms of a dimensionless slip velocity. For shear-driven flow, this dimensionless quantity is found to depend only weakly on $\Phi$ and to be independent of the height of the array relative to the height of the channel and independent of the cylinder size relative to the height of the channel. For pressure-driven flow, Us is found to be less than that under comparable shear-flow conditions, and dependent on cylinder size and filling fraction in this case. Calculations also show that the external flow penetrates the porous medium very little, even for sparse arrays, and that Us is about one quarter of the velocity predicted by the Brinkman model.},

Concepts, definitions, and equations derived for simulation errors and uncertainties provide the overall mathematical framework. Verification is defined as a process for assessing simulation numerical uncertainty and, when conditions permit, estimating the sign and magnitude of the numerical error itself and the uncertainty in that error estimate. The approach for estimating errors and uncertainties includes (1) the option of treating the numerical error as deterministic or stochastic, (2) the use of generalized Richardson extrapolation for J input parameters, and (3) the concept of correction factors based on analytical benchmarks, which provides a quantitative metric to determine proximity of the solutions to the asymptotic range, accounts for the effects of higher-order terms, and are used for defining and estimating errors and uncertainties. Validation is defined as a process for assessing simulation modeling uncertainty by using benchmark experimental data and, when conditions permit, estimating the sign and magnitude of the modeling error itself. The approach properly takes into account the uncertainties in both the simulation and experimental data in assessing the level of validation. Interpretation of results of validation efforts both where the numerical error is treated as deterministic and stochastic are discussed.

That poses the question of the respective domains of validity of both laws, as well as the question of the value of the effective viscosity $\mu$e which is present in Brinkman's equation. These two topics are addressed in this article, mainly by a priori estimates and by recalling existing analyses. Three main classes of porous media can be distinguished: "classical" porous media with a connected solid structure where the pore surface Sp is a function of the characteristic pore size lp (such as for cylindrical pores), swarms of low concentration fixed particles where the pore surface is a function of the characteristic particle size ls, and fiber-made porous media at low solid concentration where the pore surface is a function of the fiber diameter. If Brinkman's 3D flow equation is valid to describe the flow of a Newtonian fluid through a swarm of fixed particles or fibrous media at low concentration under very precise conditions (L{\'{e}}vy 1983), then we show that it cannot apply to the flow of such a fluid through classical porous media. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract = {In contrast to larger flight-capable insects such as hawk moths and fruit flies, miniature flying insects such as thrips show the obligatory use of wing-wing interaction via “clap and fling” during the end of upstroke and start of downstroke. Although fling can augment lift generated during flapping flight at chord-based Reynolds number (Re) of 10 or lower, large drag forces are necessary to clap and fling the wings. In this context, bristles observed in the wings of most tiny insects have been shown to lower drag force generated in clap and fling. However, the fluid dynamic mechanism underlying drag reduction by bristled wings and the impact of bristles on lift generated via clap and fling remain unclear. We used a dynamically scaled robotic model to examine the forces and flow structures generated during clap and fling of: three bristled wing pairs with varying inter-bristle spacing, and a geometrically equivalent solid wing pair. In contrast to the solid wing pair, reverse flow through the gaps between the bristles was observed throughout clap and fling, resulting in: (a) drag reduction; and (b) weaker and diffuse leading edge vortices that lowered lift. Shear layers were formed around the bristles when interacting bristled wing pairs underwent clap and fling motion. These shear layers lowered leakiness of flow through the bristles and minimized loss of lift in bristled wings. Compared to the solid wing, peak drag coefficients were reduced by 50-90{\%} in bristled wings. In contrast, peak lift coefficients of bristled wings were only reduced by 35-60{\%} from those of the solid wing. Our results suggest that the bristled wings can provide unique aerodynamic benefits via increasing lift to drag ratio during clap and fling for Re between 5 and 15.},
